[00:00:33]
Take good care.

[00:00:35]
Hey, what's going on, everybody? I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is February 1st, which means it's the start of Black History Month. Yes, my friends, it's that time of the year when white people who are true allies gift their black friends. A five do the right thing, guys. Don't be racist. Anyway, on tonight's show, Reetta Traitor's, a high on Silvo. Anti vaccines are ruining things for everyone.

[00:01:03]
And we introduce you to an insane Georgia woman who makes laws for the country now.

[00:01:07]
Plus, Jeremy Harris of Slave Play is joining us on the show. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:13]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with terminal use of. All right, let's kick things off with the big snowstorm that slammed into the northeast United States today, where some places will be getting up to twenty four inches of snow. In fact, there was so much snow in New York that we couldn't go anywhere and we had to stay home all day.

[00:01:47]
It was crazy. But while the sunny West Coast doesn't have to worry about snow, California is having some scary weather related problems of its own.

[00:01:55]
Amazing new drone video shows where a chunk of California's scenic Highway One collapse after heavy rainstorms last week. Both lanes near Big Sur washed down into the Pacific Ocean. That landslide left a massive gap in the highway and a deep ravine littered with fallen trees. Thankfully, nobody was hurt there. Transportation officials have no estimate of how long it might take to actually fix that. Merchants say that collapsed just another major blow to the area's tourism industry.

[00:02:23]
Nah, man, if anything, I think a big hole like that is going to help the tourism industry. Let me just look at the Grand Canyon. They want to patch that up years ago, but it's so popular that they've never even bothered. Now, luckily, nobody was on this road when it collapsed, but they do have to fix this road ASAP, because since we all have GPS now, I don't know how obvious that hole is going to be.

[00:02:47]
People are just going to be like, I mean, yeah, it looks like a hole, but Google says we should just go straight. So, I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

[00:02:57]
And this does look scary, but you know who did enjoy it, that panda from the National Zoo. Oh, if only we all looked at adorable plunging to our deaths. Let's move on now to the coronavirus pandemic. The only thing with more mutations than Rudy Giuliani. The big issue right now is getting people vaccinated as quickly as possible. And now there's yet another thing making that harder than it should be assholes.

[00:03:25]
The Los Angeles Times says dozens of anti vaccination protesters disrupted operations at one of the largest vaccine sites in the country. They blocked entrances and forced the inoculation center at Dodger Stadium to close for about an hour Saturday. Hundreds of people waited in their cars to get shots. Some city officials are calling for increased security at testing and vaccination locations.

[00:03:47]
Whoa. These people in L.A. had to sit in their cars for an hour. How did they notice what all the real the what the fuck t vexes if you don't want the vaccine and don't get one.

[00:04:01]
I don't agree with you, but don't ruin it for everyone else. Like we don't come interrupt you when you're busy dying of measles, because here's what I don't understand. Why does it always have to be the most ridiculous people who are the most fired up? Like why can't anti vaccines be like those Instagram models were last summer, you know, with just post a black square on Instagram for one day and then never bring up vaccines again. But let's move on now to international news.

[00:04:23]
Ten years ago, the country of Myanmar emerged from a half century of military rule to transition to civilian governments.

[00:04:32]
But yesterday, the military apparently decided that they liked it better the old way.

[00:04:37]
Breaking overnight, developments in Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma. This morning, the military there announced that it took control of the country in a coup against the democratically elected government. It detained several politicians, including the country's civilian leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The raids came hours before a new session of parliament was scheduled to open and members who won the November elections were set to take their seats. The military alleges voter fraud in the November election.

[00:05:07]
Oh, man. Trump must be kicking himself right now. I don't know why I didn't think about using the military. Can I have a coup over? And here's the thing. I know it's sometimes hard to get Americans to care about another country's politics. So if Myanmar wants to get the US to pay attention, they should change the country's name again, this time to the Capitol building. Yeah, because if Americans heard that there was a coup at the Capitol building, then then at least care about that for like two weeks.

[00:05:36]
But I am hoping for the best for the people of Myanmar. And what this shows us is that maintaining a civilian led democracy isn't easy and can't be taken for granted. When you think about it, civilians controlling the military is an amazing accomplishment in the first place because the military has way more power. You know, it's like the political equivalent of having a pet tricks. What did I say about jumping on the couch bed?

[00:06:00]
And finally, let's move on from the coup in Myanmar to the ongoing coup on Wall Street last week. You probably remember day traders won't read it shocked the markets by driving stocks in GameStop, an AMC movie theaters higher than the queen's here in Britain. But now Reddit has its eye on something even more shiny.

[00:06:19]
The GameStop saga continues to grow. It's not just stocks anymore, though. Reddit users are buying up silver, pushing up the value of the precious metal. Silver has now hit a five month high at nearly thirty bucks an ounce. That Reddit group says that they're doing it because big banks, specifically JP Morgan Chase, have been, quote, suppressing metals for a long time.

[00:06:41]
Over the weekend, retail sites that sell silver coins and silver bars said that they were getting hit by unprecedented demand and they couldn't meet the demand.

[00:06:50]
It's been incredible, pretty much physical silver. It's almost all gone in terms of life inventory.

[00:06:56]
We typically have about a thousand silver products in inventory available for purchase. We're getting so cleaned out right now that we're actually, last I checked, down to about 80 items in stock, which is a number I've never seen before and never thought we would ever see. The entire industry is frankly wiped out in terms of actually finding life silver that you can purchase and receive today. It's becoming impossible.

[00:07:18]
Oh, hey, I'm rich, I tell ya. Oh, that's right, people.

[00:07:24]
Now, silver prices are skyrocketing, which is going to cause confusion at the next Olympics. I mean, if silver is more valuable than gold, everyone's going to try and get second place. Sprinters will be at the finish line like after you met FDR.

[00:07:36]
But after you know, I'm always going first, but I'm always going first. You go ahead of me. Why don't you go ahead of me this time? You can go first right now.

[00:07:44]
While some Reddit users say that driving silver prices higher will cripple banks like JP Morgan, others claim that this movement is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms because it would help the banks. And I believe this because, of course, Wall Street will do that when Wall Street sees a scam going, it doesn't try to stop it, it tries to join in. If Wall Street caught you, robbing its mom would be like, hey, hey, look, I don't want to take off our shoes.

[00:08:09]
Sometimes she hides cash in there. Get in there. Let me get in there with.

[00:08:13]
It's coordinated by the banks themselves a lot. The fact is the credit surge is now spreading from game stock to silver to all sorts of stocks. And one of our correspondents has a pitch for where it should go next.

[00:08:24]
Are you a creditor looking to stick it to the hedge funds? Well, forget about GameStop and Silver.

[00:08:30]
You got to invest in Kiwi's. I'm lighting. And Kiwi's are the investment opportunity that Wall Street doesn't want you to know about. They're portable. They hold their intrinsic value. And it's easy to think you're ordering 10 from Amazon and miraculously wind up with ten crates.

[00:08:49]
Here's a fact.

[00:08:50]
As far as we know, every single hedge fund is shorting Kiwi's. And are we going to let them do that to America's national fruit? I don't think so. But if we all buy Kiwi's, then rocket ship and Kiwis are more than an investment.

[00:09:08]
They go great in fruit salads. They can be organic Trepp nuts, and they're the only fruit covered in fur. So if you ever wonder what it's like to take a bite out of a hamster, now you can with Kiwi's.

[00:09:25]
And the best part is you don't even have to go through those Wall Street fat cats to get your Kiwi's, just call me and let me know how many you want, whether five or five thousand.

[00:09:37]
But this opportunity will not last forever.

[00:09:40]
Got maybe two days tops before it smells so bad in here that my landlord kicks me out. So order now. And remember, the more Kiwis we all buy, the more the hedge funds suffer.

[00:09:50]
It's just economics. So called today. Please, honey, what did you do? I'm handling it.

[00:10:01]
All right. When we come back, we'll look at one of the newest and most terrifying stars of the Republican Party. You don't want to miss it.

[00:10:10]
Hey, they're surprisingly brilliant, is back for season two with more of the most shocking, inspiring and downright bizarre stories from science history. I'm married.

[00:10:19]
I'm Greg and surprisingly brilliant tells the little known stories behind the science that shaped the world. We kick off season two with the story of Rosalind Franklin and DNA. Although the thing is it might not be the story you're expecting.

[00:10:32]
And we've got a baker's dozen more stories of science's mishaps and misadventures coming after that from the very first ever picture of a human coronavirus to how birth control was developed and from the gruesome journey to the first ever vaccine to how to win at everything.

[00:10:50]
Join us as we dive deep into the forgotten corners of science, history and subscribe so you never miss an episode.

[00:10:56]
Listen to surprisingly brilliant on the I Heart radio app, on Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. OK, so we're supposed to be sticking to the script, but we ain't because this is not what we do is figure out the yeah, and it's A.J. Hey, hey, we're giving a whole bunch of good, bad advice and a lot of bad redivide, trying to teach you how to say when, how and how much. Yes. Now, that doesn't always have to apply to your sex life, lady.

[00:11:28]
It can absolutely apply to your career unless your sex life is your career. And in this age, we'll be talking about a whole lot of sex. I love the sex in a place and the love of money and relationship, and we're going to work on it.

[00:11:47]
So listen to our new show. We Talk Back every Thursday on the radio app, Apple podcast, or wherever you get your podcast. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Last year's election brought a lot of new faces to Washington, D.C., but just like that kid at Sleep Away camp who keeps wetting the bed, one of them may be going home.

[00:12:12]
Early tonight, growing outrage at newly elected Representative Marjorie Taylor Green. The noted conspiracy theorist and ardent Trump supporter from Georgia, is facing calls to resign and a long shot bid to expel her from Congress after a review of her social media found in twenty, eighteen and 19, she repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a widely shared video from twenty nineteen Al Green declaring Pelosi a traitor, implying she should be executed.

[00:12:41]
It's a crime punishable by death is not treason. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.

[00:12:48]
She's called for the hanging of Barack Obama. She's called for the hanging of Hillary Clinton.

[00:12:53]
Right now they're trying to expel me from Congress, yet they don't like I don't like a lot of the things I say and do. They're they're you know, it's a witch hunt.

[00:13:04]
Yeah. They don't like the things you said because you called for the execution. They're not looking for a witch hunt. They're looking to stay alive. I mean, people. What kind of psychopath calls for the execution of America's leaders on Facebook? I mean, at least if he did it on Snapchat, it would be harder to find. Also, the puppy knows makes you seem less crazy. And here's why I take this assassination. Talk seriously from Marjorie Taylor Green.

[00:13:29]
She's got three names. Assassins always have three names. Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth, Neil Patrick Harris. That guy kills every award show. So who is this person that might get expelled from Congress after less than a month? Well, let's get to know her and our brand new segment, Fringe Watching.

[00:13:51]
Meet Marjorie Taylor Green in Congress, she represents Georgia's 14th District right outside Atlanta. And in life, she represents some views right outside of reality.

[00:14:05]
Marjorie Taylor Green, she won her house race for a district in northwest Georgia. She has in the past promoted the Kuhnen conspiracy theories.

[00:14:12]
Q is a patriot. We know that for sure, but we do not know who Q is. People believe that. Q Is someone very close to President Trump? According to him, many in our government are actively worshipping Satan or they call Moloch. I mean, is it going to be true that the child pedophilia and the elites in the Washington DC, is that what we're really going to see come out? Is it going to be satanic worship?

[00:14:39]
Who was in the House of Representatives? Now, Marjorie Taylor Green is hardly the first member of Congress to hold some out of their beliefs. I mean, Ted Cruz believes that beard is working for him. But Kuhnen is not just extreme. It's delusional people. How are you going to be in the government and believe that the government is full of Satan worshipping sex predators? I mean, it must be exhausting to be walking around the halls of Congress just constantly opening doors like, ha, no, just a supply closet that, you know, just a copy room.

[00:15:17]
But, you know, that's my office, man. I'm so lost. And it's not just Kuhnen. In fact, it seems like Green has a conspiracy theory for every letter of the alphabet.

[00:15:29]
The Trump backing Republican embraces completely false Kuhnen conspiracy theories. And in a newly uncovered video from twenty eighteen claimed former President Obama is Muslim.

[00:15:40]
The Clintons had JFK Jr. killed and even questioned whether a plane crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11.

[00:15:48]
It's odd there's never any evidence shown for a plane and the Pentagon. Facebook posts have surfaced in which Green called the deadly Parkland High School shooting fake, along with video showing her harassing Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg's. Why are you supporting red flag gun laws that attack our Second Amendment right? How do you get avid gun owners and people that support the Second Amendment to give up their guns and go along with anti-gun legislation? How do you do that? Maybe you accomplished that by performing a mass shooting into a crowd that is very likely to be conservative.

[00:16:27]
Is that what happened in Las Vegas?

[00:16:28]
Have you seen the picture of Ruth Bader Gingrich walking to the airport?

[00:16:33]
Yeah, like a body double for Hillary Clinton. So it's interesting. So I do not believe that was raised. No, I don't think so. I don't know. Wow.

[00:16:44]
OK, so RBG has a body double. Hillary Clinton has a body double. This one makes it sound like everyone has their own body double. I mean, that's such a silly thing to believe you over the weekend.

[00:16:58]
They're on to us. Get out of them. And. But the big question is, how did Osama bin Karen get elected to Congress in the first place? Well, it turns out she was lucky to be one of nine Republicans running for the seat. So everyone's attention was spread around instead of focused all on her. Kind of like how there are so many different kinds of orio now that you hardly even notice that one of the flavors is human flesh.

[00:17:22]
And while some of the Kulen stuff did come out, mostly what voters knew about her was that she was a hardcore Trump supporter, and yet she sometimes sounded like a crazy person, but only in a comforting, familiar way.

[00:17:35]
She's a former Crosthwaite gym owner who has had a few roles at her father's construction company, but really has no political background at all.

[00:17:44]
America is the greatest country in the world. We need conservatives in Washington that will keep it that way. The Democrat Party is no longer an American party. They are now the party of socialism. They want to rip our borders wide open. They want to kill babies up until birth and maybe even afterwards. I have a message for anti that terrorists stay the hell out of northwest Georgia Goddam.

[00:18:09]
I know which house I'm skipping on Halloween. And by the way, everyone is freaking out about Greens Kulen beliefs. But if you ask me, the scary cult she's involved in is Crosthwaite. I mean, that's just just Scientology with jumping jacks. But yes, aside from the cult stuff, a lot of Greens beliefs are pretty typical for today's Republicans.

[00:18:29]
But she also has a little extra something that makes the far right love her even more.

[00:18:36]
It's racism.

[00:18:37]
Marjorie Taylor Green also has a track record of incendiary and racist rhetoric. There is an Islamic invasion into our government offices right now.

[00:18:47]
If you want Islam and Sharia law, you stay over there in the Middle East, you stay there and you're going to Mecca and do all your thing. And you know what? You can have a whole bunch of wives or goats or sheep or whatever you want.

[00:19:01]
But that doesn't make me a racist because I disagree. As I say, leave the statue up there. The most mistreated group of people in the United States today are white males.

[00:19:10]
When a now deleted Facebook post green question whether California's deadly campfire in twenty eighteen was started by lasers beamed down from outer space lasers, she says, somehow connected to the Rothschilds, the Jewish European banking family, the target of some of the oldest, laziest, most dangerous anti-Semitic tropes on the books, Jewish space lasers.

[00:19:35]
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Jewish space lasers. What is this lady just playing? Conspiracy slot machine.

[00:19:41]
I'm going with whatever comes up because here's my question.

[00:19:47]
If you were secretly starting a forest fire, why would you use a space laser when you could just use, I don't know, matches? It's such a waste of a Jewish space laser.

[00:19:57]
It's like using the Death Star to make s'mores, make sure they're toast. And honestly, guys, if you're anti Semitic, this is a weird way to try and get people on your side, because when I hear someone saying Jews have a space laser, I'm like, awesome, can I join? I will say, though, it is impressive that Green has some wild racist theory for every group. I mean, no wonder she got elected because she's like, I want to be a congresswoman for everyone, whether you hate Jews, blacks, Muslims or filthy Canadians, I'm on your side.

[00:20:32]
So that's who Margery Taylor Greene was before she started threatening to kill Democrats. And her calls for violence are nothing new. While some Republicans only came around to supporting an insurrection after Donald Trump lost the election, Green was rallying the troops even before November twenty twenty.

[00:20:49]
If this generation doesn't stand up and defend freedom, it's gone. Yeah, and once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself. The only way you get your freedoms back is that it's earned with the price of blood.

[00:21:02]
When we rise up, we can end all of this. We can end it. We can do it peacefully, we can. I hope it doesn't have to we don't have to do it the other way. I hope not, but we should feel like we will if we have to. OK, guys, I'm sorry, but calls for a violent revolution just don't have the same weight when you're streaming from your hotel room. It's time for the people to rise up and take back their freedoms.

[00:21:33]
Excuse me, can I get another towel, please? Because I'm going to the pool. Yeah. Thank you so much.

[00:21:38]
Less spill some beer. No, the cabana will be fine. Thank you. So now that all these death threats and conspiracy theories have come to light, Congress is trying to figure out how to deal with Green. Do you sentier her? Do you expel her? Do you use a secret Jewish space laser to distract her like a cat? I mean, one thing's for sure, while Congress tries to decide what to do with her, she's out there getting stuff done herself.

[00:22:05]
Georgia Congressman Marjorie Taylor Green calling on President Biden to be impeached, found articles of impeachment on President Joe Biden.

[00:22:12]
We'll see how this goes. What a letdown. Marjorie Taylor Greene came to Washington calling for executions and a few weeks later, she's already settling for impeachment. And I guess Congress will turn anyone into a moderates. But you know what? I have a conspiracy theory of my own. I think Marjorie Taylor Greene is secretly a Democrat. Think about it. She's making Republicans look unhinged. She's from Georgia, which we all know is a blue state. And she's a member of Congress, which she herself believes is a satanic demonic cult.

[00:22:51]
Now, if I'm correct and Marjorie Taylor Green is a Democrats, well, that's great news for everyone, because that would be the only way that Republicans would actually want to hold her accountable for anything she's done. All right. When we come back, playwright Jaromil Harris will talk to us about his groundbreaking play Slave Play.

[00:23:11]
You don't miss it. Who is David Bowie? Well, it depends on who you ask or which records you play. To some, he's Ziggy Stardust, to others, the thin. Why do more Major Tom? But who is David Bowie, really? To answer that question will have to go off the record.

[00:23:34]
My name is Jordan Ron Talk and I'm the host of Off the Record, a new music biography podcast from my heart. Radio Off the record goes beyond the songs and into the hearts and minds of rock's greatest legends. Every season profiles one classic artist taking listeners on a wild ride through their extraordinary career. The first season examines the life or rather lives of David Bowie. Each episode of the 11 part audio event tells the story of one of his iconic personas.

[00:24:01]
Together, these faces form an intimate portrait of one of the 20th century's most influential figures. So who was David Bowie?

[00:24:09]
Tune in to. Off the record to find out, listen and follow on the radio Apple podcast wherever you listen to your favorite shows. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I had the privilege of speaking with award winning playwrights Jeremy Harris. His Broadway production Slave Play was recently nominated for a record breaking 12 Tony Awards. So we talked about that's how he's trying to help keep the theater industry alive, what he's doing during the coronavirus pandemic and so much more.

[00:24:44]
Jamir Harris, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:24:47]
Thank you for having me. Had I known you were going to challenge my fro, I would have blown off my fro. But I feel like you you snuck up on me. This is not cool what you've just done here, because I can do that. But I was like, I don't like doing that to people because then they feel intimidated. And I didn't think you were going to do this.

[00:25:04]
Well, I mean, I did know that I was in an African man's television show. This is like I wanted to like, you know, walk in the step of like, you know, pass African liberationists past and Africanist and, like, live in a full 70 Spyro moment for you. I like that. I switched it up. They also they also told me that you've been wearing sweatshirts on this show and I want to equities a hoodie. And I was like, I'm not going to do that.

[00:25:33]
That's for me, that felt like utter, like utter, like beautiful privilege, like beauty privilege. You have light skin privilege.

[00:25:40]
You have like and I'm like my mom in Virginia is going to be like, what the hell is Jeremy doing with natural hair? And like on in the show.

[00:25:52]
But I think I think you look fantastic, Jeremy. That's you know, what it is for me is that people often ask me. They are like, why are you wearing the hoodies? Why? What is the hoodie? This is how I dress when I'm at home and I'm not in the mood to act like I have not been at home for a year. Yes, I get to pop outside. Not again when we're all at home. So I'm not going to now live in a world where I'm going to be uncomfortable, like I'll wear a suit outside because I'm outside, but I won't wear the suit inside because I'm inside, you know what I mean?

[00:26:20]
So I will make my pandemic experience as comfortable as possible. And I hope you would do the same. You look fabulous. Thought. Well, that's that's a stunning jacket. That's a nice color. That's a nice shirt. It feels like you. So what are you doing now before we talk about the plan, all the accolades, what are you up to?

[00:26:35]
I've been sitting at home wondering if I even know how to write a play one, because I think that, like, a big thing for me is that, like, I, I think about theater as like community building in a way, like I think everyone. You've made it to Broadway. How did you do that? Like you you wanted to go to like I did want to do any of this. I wanted to make a play for my small group of friends in a gale.

[00:26:57]
So I wrote my second year in grad school. There's three years there, my second year with my classmates, and then third year it was off Broadway, like it was just like a really random series of occurrences and. Oh, God, oh God. Sorry, I got calls. My my my friend is calling me over and over again, and I didn't know that that was going to happen. Oh, that's really funny.

[00:27:22]
So that's freezing up our picture right now. Hold on. We'll get it back. Wait a second. It'll come back.

[00:27:28]
Just going to tell her that I wait.

[00:27:33]
I'll call you back. I'm on The Daily Show.

[00:27:42]
That would be a fun thing. I wonder how many times this happened to your guests.

[00:27:46]
I don't think it's ever happened, actually. Take the. I've completely lost you. This is so weird. I didn't take the call. I think it's just because. Is it in my back now? Oh, there you are. There you are. You back? Great, great. Look, I'm going to do this and make sure that face time doesn't come back. That's the issue. Turn face, time off. You see, this is fun, this is what I love about this now.

[00:28:12]
Now imagine you see now if I was wearing a suit for this moment right now, I would feel like something had gone wrong. But because I'm wearing a hoodie, I'm like, we're just it's just happening. Life is just happening right now.

[00:28:22]
You know, Broadway is one of the hottest, hottest, hottest places to get anything on.

[00:28:27]
You can just break into it. Jeremy, you broke into it with a play that many would argue would never make it onto Broadway. It is one of the most risque things. So I went to watch Slave play and I remember sitting there and I won't spoil it for people. But I remember for the first, like, 10 minutes, 50 minutes was like, this is the worst thing in my life. This is this is horrible.

[00:28:47]
And what was happening around me was there were a lot of, like, racist jokes being said. And I was just like and people were laughing around me. And I was I was really uncomfortable. I was like, wow. I was like, so clearly, this is not for me. This is for some of these old white folk. They're having a great time right now. And then the play switches. And then I started laughing and then people around me didn't laugh anymore.

[00:29:10]
And I remember the entire time I walked out of it going this it's it's like similar experiences I've had with, like, The Matrix or Devil's Advocate or just an experience that takes you through a story that warps how you seen the world around you. It seems like a play about interracial relationships. But then when the when the George Street protests happened, people were using the play and using quotes from the play and ideas from the plays in the streets while they were protesting.

[00:29:38]
Talk me through some of that. Like, it seems like it's one thing, but it feels like it's so many other things. What was slave play meant for you? What were you what are you trying to do? Because it seems like it achieved everything.

[00:29:49]
Yeah, I mean, I, I was a black kid who had been in white schools for most of my life. Right. And like, you know, when you are that one of those few black kids who were in, like predominantly white spaces, you tend to either be attracted to all of these these groups of white people that will always make you feel like an other and never make you feel like you have as much worth. Or you'll find the other black people that are in those programs and like form little pods and find little ways to bolding yourself outside of the sort of like psychic terror of being around white folks.

[00:30:20]
Every time that you write your classroom or walk down the street and having to do all I can, I touch your hair, can I do this? And then, like, the minute you say, like, I like everyone's races, you're like, I'm not racist.

[00:30:31]
So I wanted to make a play that ostensibly told all of those kids who feel gas lit by the systems and the institutions. They are part of that like, hey, you're not wrong. The people around you are racist. Even if they say they are or the people around you are dealing with years and years and years of systems in the same way that you are, even if they feel like separate from the system. Right. And you're not wrong to want to call it out.

[00:30:58]
And for me, because bribery was never the goal or never the option, I feel very emboldened to talk to the producers who want to take you there and be like if you're going to take this to Broadway, it has to be for the same people that I wrote it for. I can't take this play to Broadway and then be like, OK, now only white people who have American Express's and can afford 400 all tickets can come see it. I was like, the tickets have to be affordable.

[00:31:18]
It has to be privileged. We have to privilege black people, young people, etc. And luckily we were able to do that, which was amazing.

[00:31:26]
I'm not shocked that your play has been nominated for a record. Twelve awards. Congratulations. Like to have twelve nominations is unheard of and it's amazing. And I hope you win every single one of them because oftentimes when we talk about racism and systemic racism in society, we speak about it through the lens of like overt hatred, you know, but it is really hard to have these conversations with the nuance that it deserves when you're talking about it through the lens of love.

[00:31:52]
The whole of slave play is about love. It's about how couples love each other. It's about how people love each other. It's about how families, how friends love each other and how race either adds a complexity or an added dynamic to that love. Was that a big part of it? Or why was love so crucial for you? Because when you were watching the play, at no point do you think that any of those white people does not love the black people that they were interacting with.

[00:32:17]
You don't even not like them. You understand that everybody is being subject to the system.

[00:32:22]
Well, I mean, it's because I mean, I grew up in the south, right. And so in the south, there are certain things that are like very plain spoken. And that's why I like the South, because, like in the South, I had friends who I knew for a fact like like adored me. I don't know, love was what happened, but they adored me. They were obsessed with me. But they'd be in a car in there and we'd be on the carpool.

[00:32:43]
We'd be talking about Pokémon or whatever we're talking about. Their dad would start whistling Dixie in the carpool. This is a real story. And they would whistle along. And I didn't know what Winn-Dixie was. But then I learned the song and I come home and then I'd sing the song to my mom, which you do. And that's that's a racist song. What are you talking about, Mark? And then I'm like, you go back and you tell them that's racist.

[00:33:05]
I'll go back. I tell them, Andre. Oh, my God. You know, my my grandma, my grandpappy did fight for the Confederacy and I guess I am a little bit racist. I'm sorry that made you feel weird. Anyway, go on. When I moved north, I would be in situations with hyper ambitious other like students, many of whom are white, who would say things or do things that were based on race or race and race.

[00:33:30]
So they'd be like, well, Jeremy might be one of the smartest people here, but, you know, he got in because, like, the reason he could get in, right. Because he's black or the reason it's like no one knows my S.A.T. scores are like which I'm sure I'll test you, you know, but like things, little things.

[00:33:45]
And then when you say, like, that's racist, like, no, it's funny. I learned I learned this from Tina Fey or I learned this from, you know, all these jokes that, you know, the in the mid two thousand years and everyone felt safe. Comedy Central, NBC, all these places were like built up around liberal comedians saying like racist things that made black and brown people feel weird. They were told they couldn't because they were they all voted for Obama.

[00:34:08]
And so I started to think a lot about how the most insidious form of racism is a kind of racism that we see perpetrated by people that like in their voting, that are liberals who like vote against policies that young, black and brown people. And so I became really obsessed with this sort of entanglement. Right. Sort of like entailment that is based around mutual respect, mutual love, but like where in that respect is hampered by being blind to the ways in which being socialized white has like a challenge, has made it almost impossible for you to understand the complexities of any anybody that's not your own.

[00:34:49]
I really do appreciate how you've created a conversation that is honest, that is heartbreaking. That is funny. As funny as shit, man, it's one of the funniest things you ever watch. And it leaves people, in my opinion, walking out, going, man, I see the world in a slightly different way and I see the way I participate in the world in a slightly different way. And so, yeah, I would add even more nominations to year 12.

[00:35:12]
I can talk to you for hours, but maybe maybe we'll catch up on another day. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for being here. And thank you for creating Jeremy. I appreciate you. Can I just say one thing before we go? Of course. We have to get the thing that the thing that I really want to say is that if we really want more people to see this right, we want as many people as possible to see this.

[00:35:29]
We have to think about the fact that in America, theater is on its last legs. All of the arts are on their last legs. I want everyone to look into Banaz Hero and the work that they are doing and also to research the Federal Theatre Project and the Federal Arts Project, which was one of FDR like plans instead of the New Deal where you made federal one and put money into the hands of artists not just in New York, not just on Broadway, but everywhere, because the multiple billions of dollars that arts bring to the economy are necessary.

[00:36:03]
And I know it's fun to think about theatre as like that bad musical your son or daughter was in that you like through. But like, you know, theatre is what made fleabag is what made I destroy you is what helped make the the foundational principles of all of the shows you watch on Netflix, Hulu. Yes. All of these other places. And if you want to make sure that there's a new generation of people who are still able to do that, who didn't starve while they were trying to do that, please, please, please ask your representatives to bail them out, bill all of them out, because, like, I'm a lucky artist, I'm fine.

[00:36:34]
I'm sitting in like a gorgeous apartment right now. But there are plenty of people who are my peers, plenty of people who are above me, who are inspirations to me, who are struggling to figure out how they're going to get their next meal. Because we've thought more about Wall Street bailouts. We've thought about the art sector bailouts and those are important. They feed our soul and they also help reshape how we think about America in significant ways.

[00:36:57]
We'll make sure we do that then. Thank you, man. Don't be a stranger. Look after yourself. I won't. I won't. Thanks. All right.

[00:37:03]
Thanks again, Jeremy. Now, in case you're wondering, Jeremy himself has created a collection of plays by black writers called the Golden Collection for more information about the Golden Collection, including how to buy its, please check out the link below. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this.

[00:37:21]
I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and it could happen here. And boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.

[00:38:04]
The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts, or wherever you listen to podcasts, Gammie plans this afternoon.

[00:38:21]
Check out people every day.
