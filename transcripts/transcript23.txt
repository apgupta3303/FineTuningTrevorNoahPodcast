You're listening to Comedy Central. OK, now listen, this may be the case, A.J., and it's Tambien, and we're giving great, bad advice. Never give a bad, great advice on our new show. We Talk Back. Yeah, talking about a whole lot of sex. I love the sex and a bunch of money. We love the money in relationships. We don't work on it. It feels like. Yes. And listen to we talk back every Thursday on the radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your packages.

[00:00:40]
My name is Redock. I am Ellen Bernstein. Brodsky, this is called your grandmother. What's the matter with you?

[00:00:48]
Well, and it is a podcast about the relationship between grandmothers and grandchildren, as my mother would have said, TACA, who wouldn't have wanted a Jewish grandmother?

[00:00:58]
Sometimes she accidentally live. Streams were like, who going to tell her?

[00:01:02]
I'm just hearing about this now. Listen to your grandmother on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.

[00:01:19]
The big issue right now is getting people vaccinated as quickly as possible. And now there's yet another thing making that harder than it should be assholes.

[00:01:30]
The Los Angeles Times says dozens of anti vaccination protesters disrupted operations at one of the largest vaccine sites in the country. They blocked entrances and forced the inoculation center at Dodger Stadium to close for about an hour Saturday. Hundreds of people waited in their cars to get shots. Some city officials are calling for increased security at testing and vaccination locations.

[00:01:53]
Whoa. These people in L.A. had to sit in their cars for an hour. How did they notice what all the real the what the fuck t vexes if you don't want the vaccine and don't get one.

[00:02:06]
I don't agree with you, but don't ruin it for everyone else. Like we don't come interrupt you when you're busy dying of measles, because here's what I don't understand. Why does it always have to be the most ridiculous people who are the most fired up? Like why can't anti vaccines be like those Instagram models were last summer, you know, with just post a black square on Instagram for one day and then they bring up vaccines again.

[00:02:29]
Western Australia went into total lockdown after discovering its first coronavirus case in 10 months. You see, Australia is very different from the United States in the US. Water goes down the drain clockwise, and in Australia, they care about stopping coronavirus. Now, part of the reason for Australia's success is that Australians don't resist the government as much when they tell them that they should stay at home. And it's partly because these people know that covid is a serious disease.

[00:03:00]
It's also partly because it lets Australians stay away from all the other things in Australia that could kill them. And it's bad enough that the scorpions and snakes are trying to kill me. But there's a koala that's trying to get me in every day. Now, eventually, of course, the world will reemerge from the pandemic.

[00:03:17]
And I know everyone thinks that they're going to jump right back into their old lives, you know, like going to bars or theatres or using the bottom half of your face to express emotion. But you might want to prepare for a period of adjustment because some things apparently take a little time to relearn.

[00:03:35]
A new report says some pilots are getting rusty on the job due to the pandemic because, well, there are fewer planes to fly. Some pilots grounded for months by the pandemic have seen the skills and proficiency suffer. For instance, one pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake, damaging a tow truck that was trying to pull that plane from the gate. In another case, the pilot, while forgot to turn on the empty icing mechanism. Other reports include lining up the wrong runway for landing.

[00:04:07]
To counter such rustiness, the FAA stops pilots from flying a commercial jet unless they have performed at least three takeoffs and three landings, either on a plane or in a simulator in the previous 90 days.

[00:04:21]
I don't know about you, but this is kind of scary. Apparently, you never forget how to ride a bike, but you forget how to fly a plane after like five days. Oh, man, this is going to change everything. Next time the plane hits turbulence, the pilot's going to jump on the intercom like, are there any hijackers on board?

[00:04:39]
We need someone who knows how to fly the plane. Harpreet, any hijackers, please make yourself known to the cabin crew.

[00:04:44]
And listen, I get that pilots are human and everyone makes mistakes at their jobs, but there are certain jobs where there is way less room for error. You know, like as a mail carrier, you might say, oh, whoops, this package was supposed to go to apartment two and accidentally sent it to apartment three. But as a pilot, it's more like a Poopsie. These people were supposed to go to Miami and I accidentally sent them to heaven.

[00:05:06]
And trust me, now, this is not just going to be pilots, people. Everyone is going to be rusty off to covid projectionists are going to be showing movies upside down. Bouncers are going to be letting in groups of ugly dudes and telling beautiful women they got on the wrong shoes. Bullies are going to give you their lunch money.

[00:05:23]
Until the pandemic is actually over, Americans are going to need more help getting through it and the big question of what that help will look like is dominating Washington, D.C. right now.

[00:05:36]
President Biden's pledge of bipartisanship facing its first test tonight. The president inviting 10 Republican senators to the Oval Office to pitch their covid relief counteroffer. Their six hundred billion dollar proposal is a mere fraction of the president's one point nine dollars trillion dollar package. The GOP plan leaves out a minimum wage boost. The president includes and whittles down his fourteen hundred dollar direct payments to Americans to one thousand dollars.

[00:06:03]
Still, when all was said and done, the White House did not appear to be conceding much ground, saying the president will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.

[00:06:12]
This is a sign of this effort from President Biden to get bipartisanship here. But it also comes as Democrats on Capitol Hill are paving the way to move forward with only Democratic votes for this relief package.

[00:06:24]
Look, man, I'm not going to lie. I get why Democrats and Republicans are having trouble agreeing on this relief package. I mean, this is a difference of one point three trillion dollars. How do you compromise when you're that far apart? It's like deciding what you want to get for dinner and you want something nice, but your date wants to eat out of a gas station, trash can. You can't compromise and eat out of a nice trash can.

[00:06:48]
But I also do love how Republicans suddenly get stingy the second that a Democrat comes into office, because don't forget, during the Trump years, they were handing out tax cuts with a strip of money gun. But now that Biden is president, suddenly they're trying to hand out covid relief a penny at a time, one penny to OpenEdge. Am I making it rain yet? Three pennies? Yes. More of a drizzle. I agree. Now, a lot of people are upset about the Democrats plan to give people fourteen hundred dollars because they say that the Democrats promised to give people two thousand dollars.

[00:07:23]
But the Democrats are arguing that everybody already got the first six hundred a month ago. And I get the Democrats point on this one. But at the same time, so many people are struggling right now. Why not just give them twenty six hundred instead? I mean, you can find the money somewhere. Just take it from spaceports. Trump is gone. We don't have to pretend that that's a thing anymore.

[00:07:40]
Hey, guys, Ben Bass here. And I'm the creator of a crazy little show called BLAW Concern for Comedy Central Digital. And I'm Christopher Hitchens, plus the voice of Clarkson, whose name is well, son, we made this insane show at the studio that makes robot chicken.

[00:07:52]
Markinson is a mixed media puppet show that follows an overly manly father named Blac, who desperately tries to connect with his overly nerdy son.

[00:07:59]
He got some really cool people involved just in Royal and Donald Faison, Jane Lynch, Jim Rash, Debra Baker, Jr..

[00:08:04]
It's a really fun show that we're really proud of, and it's available right now on Comedy Central's YouTube channel.

[00:08:09]
So go check it out. Children, they like puppies that walk on two legs, but with the pandemic, taking care of them is harder than ever. And guess which gender has been settled with that burden?

[00:08:26]
With child care, crisis is pushing working moms out of the labor force. More than two million women have left the workforce in the US since this pandemic began. When you look at that December jobs report on a net basis, women made up all of the job losses, losing one hundred fifty six thousand jobs. Men net gained sixteen thousand.

[00:08:46]
Even before the pandemic, women shouldered more household chores when schools shut down and daycares closed. Many women felt they had no choice but returned to jobs as homemakers.

[00:08:57]
Burnout among working moms who are juggling it all.

[00:09:00]
The home school, the child care and the demanding jobs headphones are not working right now, so I'm spending my day working while here in the square.

[00:09:14]
In the background, I usually get about an hour or so of uninterrupted time. So there is also the fun fact that my son is in band and they have to virtually and I feel so bad for that mom.

[00:09:32]
She's got to work with her kid playing French horn in the background.

[00:09:38]
Honestly speaking, all brass instruments should be illegal. No one's ever said car horns are great, but how do we bring them indoors? But look, if your kid has to play a brass instrument, then you should make sure that it's a trombone, because at least that way they can provide sound effects for your Zoome. Cause I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Chairman, but our revenue is down this quarter, thanks to me.

[00:10:03]
You've got to admit, Mom's taking on so much more these days, working home schooling their kids, running a house. It's a very different pandemic experience than childless people are having because childless people, their complaints are like, oh, man, I wasted all day watching Netflix again. I didn't even get to Hulu. Oh, man, what a tough day. But while Korona has exacerbated these problems, child care has been a major issue in America. Long before everyone started wiping down their junk mail.

[00:10:35]
It's the subject of another episode of If You Don't Know Now you know.

[00:10:48]
Let's be honest, people, America is great at many things, rebooting British TV shows, making anything flaming hot, but providing parents with childcare isn't one of them, and the consequences are felt throughout the entire country.

[00:11:05]
The U.S. is one of the only developed countries that does not have free care for young children. Overall, the cost of child care has roughly tripled since 1990, which is more than the overall rate of inflation.

[00:11:17]
The average cost of care per child is more than twenty six thousand dollars per year for parents and parts of the USA. That's more than housing and college tuition.

[00:11:26]
Childcare costs can wipe out or nearly wipe out any economic benefit the woman would get from working. As a result, women will often stay out of the workforce to care for their child.

[00:11:35]
This is going to cost upwards of seven hundred billion dollars this year to the US economy in terms of lost productivity. That's three point five percent of GDP.

[00:11:45]
Labor participation rate of women in the United States kept pace with top countries in this area. Like Norway, for instance, our economy would be one point six trillion dollars larger. Better child care is a win for everybody. There's just no downside to it.

[00:12:00]
That's right. It turns out this burden isn't just on moms. It directly impacts the entire country. America is missing out on economic growth, equality and probably invention's know like a combination refrigerator toilets. America could have had that by now if the woman who had the idea didn't have to quit her engineering job to take care of her kids. And not only does this hurt women's productivity, it also hurts men's productivity, because if women aren't in the office, then men have to spend all day mansplaining stuff to each other.

[00:12:32]
Hey, Bob, Bob, let me show you how to turn that file into a PDF. Hey, Gary, how about I show you how to save it onto the network drive? No, silly. You got a formatted correctly. Here, let me show you. Hey, do you know all the formatting shortcuts here? Let me teach you. Have you seen a Coen Brothers movie? I mean, like really seen it. Quentin Tarantino. Now, the truth is this child care problem isn't actually that difficult to solve.

[00:13:01]
All you got to do is let kids get jobs. I mean, a textile mill is just arts and crafts with quotas. But there's also another less illegal solution for child care that other countries have figured out a long time ago. You let the government pay for it.

[00:13:17]
The cost of child care is generally paid for by a combination of the government, parents and child care providers. In the US, the cost falls mostly on parents and providers in other countries like Denmark and Sweden, the government foots most of the bill.

[00:13:32]
In Sweden, tax revenue supports generous childcare programs and gives employees vast leave of absence opportunities. Those programs, in turn, helped make Swedish citizens more employable. They also don't have to ration big portions of their paychecks to things like daycare or student loans.

[00:13:48]
In Finland, the government offers public daycare for any child until the age of seven, or if the parents decide to opt out, they're entitled to paid leave the first three years of their kid's life. The French government offers a family allowance every month to help pay for child expenses all the way up until the kids 20th birthday.

[00:14:05]
On top of all this, families get tax credits for daycare and schooling expenses. It's a generous system that cost the state tens of billions of euros each year, a high cost that's worth it.

[00:14:15]
The more active women are in the workforce, the more they have babies. And more babies means more future workers and future taxpayers.

[00:14:24]
OK, I mean, that makes sense. But it's a little weird for that lady to refer to babies as future workers and taxpayers. I wonder she rolls up to her new nieces and nephews like, are you going to grow our GDP?

[00:14:39]
Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Although just for the record, she's not totally right. If the past four years have taught us anything, it's that not all kids work. But look, overall, I think these countries have it right. And it's actually sad when you see Americans get shocked when they learn how other countries handle child care, when they get three years of parental leave in Finland.

[00:15:06]
That's crazy, but it's not crazy.

[00:15:09]
It's just that other countries expect the government to make life easier for its citizens. Over there, they say, wow, it's hard to raise kids. Let's have the government help. Only America goes, wow, it's hard to raise kids, but the government needs all the money for drones and tax cuts. So sorry, Susie, I hope this iPad can raise you.

[00:15:30]
But the craziest part is we know America is capable of giving everyone access to child care because they've already done it.

[00:15:39]
Back when everything was in black and white, when World War Two came, the government started recruiting women to work in factories as the. And went out to work on the production line, Rosie the Riveter steps in when the draftees step out from 1940 to 1945, the total women in the workforce rose nearly 30 percent.

[00:15:58]
And they very brilliantly realized that if women had children, something had to be done for the children. So this was the first and only time that the American government, the federal at the federal level said, OK, we have to support child care. Essentially, the U.S. was the closest it had ever been to having universal child care. An amendment to the Lanham Act gave families access to child care six days a week, including summers and holidays. And families only had to pay roughly ten dollars a day in today's dollars.

[00:16:29]
But once the war ended and the men went back to work, government funding dried up.

[00:16:34]
You see, America was willing to pay for child care when the only alternative was being overrun by Nazis. But then once the war was over, America just got rid of it, which is not fair to moms. And it's going to make them a lot more hawkish when it comes to war. The next time America's got tension with Iran, American moms are going to be like, come on, come on, Ayatollah, you got to make this happen.

[00:16:58]
So the point is, better childcare is possible in America and it would be great if America took advantage of this global war against the coronavirus to make childcare available for everyone, because if America misses this opportunity to act, it'll continue to let down its moms, dads and worst of all, it's children.

Hi, this is Bill Clinton, please join me on why am I telling you, why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this?

[00:17:48]
Why am I telling you this?

[00:17:50]
Because it is your future on the line. From listening to my relatives and neighbors around the kitchen table or at my grandfather's store, I learned that everyone has a story and that everyone's story has value. Once you've heard a person's hopes and fears where they've been and where they want to go, your differences sort of slip away after years of being interviewed.

[00:18:13]
I'm looking forward to doing the interviewing, to having conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know and sharing stories that have shaped our lives. We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future.

[00:18:34]
Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.

[00:18:42]
I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and if you're like me, you're probably worried right now, in part because of the fascist insurrection on January 6th in Washington, D.C. But what if I were to tell you that what happened in D.C. was just the latest in more than a century of fascist attempts to take over democratic governments, many of them successful, learn about the history of these insurrections and the history of the anti fascist actions attempting to stop them.

[00:19:08]
When you listen to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. This has been a Comedy Central podcast now.
