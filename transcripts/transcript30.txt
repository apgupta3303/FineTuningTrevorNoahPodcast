You're listening to Comedy Central. Now, we've all felt left out, and for people who moved to this country, that feeling last more than a moment. We can change that. Learn how it long begins with us. Dog brought to you by the ad council.

[00:00:20]
Hey, what's going on, everybody? I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. I am extremely happy to announce that. Believe it or not, I just completed yet another New Year's resolution. That's right, my friends. I started journaling. And I've got to say, I think it's been pretty great for my state of mind during the pandemic and the quarantine.

[00:00:42]
All work and no play makes Trevor downby all work and No. Feels like it's really working anyway on tonight's show. Rich people are being shot into space. Wall Street tries to stop GameStop and Africa brings democracy to America. Plus, the multitalented Regina King is here to talk about her brand new movie that's got Oscar buzz. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:16]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the daily social distancing show with criminal. Here's a. Let's kick things off with the coronavirus pandemic. It's the reason you were able to watch crude's two on opening day in your bathtub and now there's actually some good pandemic news for a change. People cases in the US are dropping steeply for the first time ever. And the Biden administration is purchasing two hundred million more vaccine doses and plans to have the entire country vaccinated by the end of summer, which is so exciting, it means I'll be vaccinated just in time for Apple picking up partying.

[00:02:04]
I mean, partying at like the coolest orchards. I mean clubs. I go to the clubs, you know, don't I don't pick apples. And while there are still problems distributing the vaccine, some medical providers are getting creative to make sure that not a single dose goes to waste.

[00:02:19]
A snowstorm that's snarled traffic in Oregon ended up being a blessing in disguise for drivers who ended up being in the right place at the right time. That is because also stranded in that very same storm was a group of health care workers who had been administering vaccines. The workers had six doses with them and were worried the doses would go bad before they made it back. So they started giving out vaccines to others. Among those who were vaccinated was a sheriff's office employee who had been trying to get to the vaccine site when the storm hit.

[00:02:54]
OK, now that that's a pretty dope story, imagine being caught in a storm and looking into a covid vaccine that is officially the best thing to happen on a road in Oregon. I mean, normally when you get stuck up, they just die of dysentery. Then you got to restock. Now, some of the drivers, they just chose not to get vaccinated. And honestly, I get that. I mean, if some stranger in a van offered to give me a shot, I would also say, no, I learned that lesson when I was a kid.

[00:03:22]
Yeah, you can really fool me so many times, Mr. Berry. You know my uncle. But I do think that there's an important lesson here for everyone. Whenever there's a blizzard, get in your car and drive around until you stumble on someone with extra vaccines. And that, my friends, is Trevor's safety tip of the day. Moving on to travel news, if you're already planning your first post pandemic vacation, maybe you've been thinking about a flight to Paris to visit the museums or a trip to New York to see Broadway or a trip to Narnia, because you don't know that that's not a real place.

[00:03:57]
Well, for some real adventure seekers, they're planning a way more unique getaway.

[00:04:03]
And three very rich men will make up the first crew of private citizens to blast off to the International Space Station. It will cost each of them fifty five million dollars to fly on a SpaceX rocket and spend eight days on the orbiting lab next year. The men were introduced yesterday. They are 70 year old real estate entrepreneur Larry Conner of Ohio. He will be the second oldest person to fly in space. The chief executive of a Canadian investment firm, Mark Patte, will also be part of the crew, as will Israeli businessmen.

[00:04:38]
A stieber. They will be led by a former NASA astronaut. Wow.

[00:04:45]
Fifty five million dollars for an eight day vacation. And that doesn't even count the seven million they had to pay for a checked bag. But it does sound amazing. You know, I mean, part of me wishes I could be up there with them looking down at the earth at the moment. They realize that they spend fifty five million dollars to have to catch their poop before it floats away.

[00:05:08]
Another question I have is, have these people never watched movies in space? Something always goes wrong. And when it does, I don't know if it's going to help to have a real estate entrepreneur on board. Oh, my God, there's a killer alien headed straight towards us. Let's raise its rent by seven percent, which is higher than the standard five. That'll show it. We're so dead.

[00:05:31]
And finally, remember three weeks ago when a mob of Trump supporters tried to overthrow the government?

[00:05:36]
Remember that? Wow. Oh, so random, right. Well, anyway, investigators are now examining if parts of the attack were planned in advance by the proud boys. And we don't know yet how investigators are getting the information. But now we're learning that at least in the past, one of the proudest boys hasn't been too proud to squeal to the cops.

[00:05:58]
We have some new details to share with you about the leader of the right wing group, the boys. According to court documents obtained by Reuters, Enrique Toria was an informant for both the FBI and also local police in Miami. Now, it was part of a plea deal that he made after a 2012 arrest for fraud, according to court transcripts. Former and former prosecutor, the thirty six year old helped with several cases ranging from drugs to human trafficking. You may recall Torrio was arrested in the days that led up to that capital riot.

[00:06:28]
Torrio denied working with police and said, quote, I don't recall any of this.

[00:06:34]
Are you kidding me right now? The founder of the Cowboys is a snitch man, fascist bigots just aren't as trustworthy as they used to be.

[00:06:44]
The story's insane people. These dudes just stormed the capital and now they're finding out that their leader has got the FBI on speed dial when the next board meeting is going to be hella awkward.

[00:06:56]
Item one on the agenda, snitches get stitches. Item two, where are we hosting our virtual Christmas party this year, guys? Doug's mom said we can't use their virtual basement. I also love how he's like, I don't recall any of this. My dude being an FBI informant isn't the kind of thing you'd forget is like being asked if you're a virgin.

[00:07:17]
No one's like, am I? Well, let me think. I hang out with that one lady a lot. Wait, no, that was my mom. So that doesn't count.

[00:07:26]
Although to be fair to this guy, I get why someone in a hate group like the boys would want to work with the FBI. He probably sort them out like, hey, I heard your crew try to kill Martin Luther King Junior game recognizes game. But let's move on to the big story that everyone is still talking about, the GameStop stock explosion. You know, it's the reason your fourteen year old cousin just bought a Ferrari. Traders on Reddit sent the stock soaring this week, causing billions in losses for the hedge funds that bet against the video game retailers stock.

[00:07:58]
And today, Wall Street decided enough was enough. And this is a Fox News alert.

[00:08:04]
Now draw your attention to Main Street, where GameStop and AMC shares have been tumbling and trading action today as a growing number of firms move to halt trading on some stocks boosted by amateur traders on Reddit. The action is so wild that TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have restricted trading of these stocks. Wells Fargo also banning its advisors from telling clients to buy or sell GameStop and AMC.

[00:08:31]
Now, the criticism centered on Robideau for abandoning their followers here in favor of helping those who had shorted all these spots in the first place.

[00:08:39]
I don't particularly like the move on Robin Hood today. I'm talking to people this morning that say, OK, that is anticapitalism, you can't do that. A class action complaint was just filed in the Southern District of New York against Robin Hood. And this is what part of it says, and I'm quoting purposefully, willfully and knowingly, Robin Hood, remove the stock GME GameStop from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise. Thereby it goes on manipulating the open market.

[00:09:11]
Yeah, that's right, people. Wall Street was getting rocked so hard by average people buying stock in GameStop that they just stopped average people from buying it.

[00:09:21]
Yeah, the same guys, the same guys who are always like the markets must never be regulated. They must always remain free.

[00:09:30]
Those same guys are now like, oh, shit, the poor people got a hold of the freedom to turn it off, turn off the freedom. So thanks to this, Ben, the GameStop stock that a lot of people bought for a ton of money is now worth a lot less, which is probably familiar to anyone who sold a used game back to GameStop. So right now, a lot of people are understandably upset about what Wall Street is doing.

[00:09:53]
In fact, it's bringing together people from all sides.

[00:09:56]
I mean, Alsi and Ted Cruz are as far apart as Madison and Austin, and even they're both blasting the Robinhood app for blocking users from buying GameStop stocks. Everyone's mad. Even people like Jaru, Jaru, who tweeted, yo, this is what Robin Hood is doing, do not sell. And let me tell you something. When the guy who did the fire festival thinks that you're a fraud man and you're doing some shady shit now, please don't get me wrong.

[00:10:22]
This story is huge and it's complicated. So complicated that we wanted to bring on someone to talk about it more with us to help you and me understand. So earlier today, I spoke to Doug Henwood. He's an expert on the intersection between economics and politics. He's also the host of a radio show called Behind the News and the author of Wall Street How It Works and For Whom. We talked about the whole GameStop surge and what's really going on behind the curtain.

[00:10:51]
Doug Henwood, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:10:55]
Good to be here from a distance. Yes. Yes, indeed.

[00:10:58]
And it's it's a perfect time for you to be here. You have really established yourself as somebody who is not just aware of the market and participates in the market, but also calls Wall Street out for what it really is. The biggest story right now is GameStop, Wall Street hedge funds and just a lot of money that is no way and yet everywhere in the shortest way possible. How would you break this down to somebody who had no idea what was going on?

[00:11:25]
Most people, most civilians who don't really know the markets very well have the sense that it's all a big racket, kind of ludicrous, not that different from the casino, but all this is. Is that Wall Street likes to cultivate about itself that it's rational or is it allocating capital efficiency and all that efficiently and all that? It's just nonsense. It's not doing any of those things. It does a little of it. But mostly it's just a game to try to outwit your competitors and people on the other side of a trade, whatever, and run away with the most money.

[00:11:54]
It's just there's nothing terribly rational. It's driven by emotions and psychology and fear. And most recently, over the last year or so, by a gusher of something like three trillion dollars in Federal Reserve money, which is been power, the market. So it's that sense that a lot of people have that this is all a bit of a racket is completely accurate.

[00:12:15]
So it seems like like you're saying, it's like basically people came into the casino and said, we're going to play against the house and we're going to make a lot of money. What's interesting here is a market that is oftentimes termed free and capitalistic has now been stopped. Can you explain that? Why why was why was it stopped? Have these people broken the rules? Have they have they done anything wrong?

[00:12:35]
Well, I think there are a couple of things going on. One is these predators, they're just the wrong kind of people, but they're playing the same game that Wall Street does and they're getting together, talking up a stock, talking down a stock, trying to figure out the other guy's positions, looking who's weak, attacking them. They do Wall Street professionals do this sort of thing all the time. And I think it's very funny to hear their professions of outrage that this is just not moral.

[00:12:57]
You know, it's not fair. It's like the markets are supposed to be on the up and up and these guys are not playing fair. That's just utter nonsense. They're just the wrong kind of people. But I think the other thing is. Yeah, are they just trying to protect their own? And Robin Hood a little likes to present itself as a democratic institution.

[00:13:17]
The democratic broker for the masses are going to overturn the Wall Street order. It's deeply plugged into the Wall Street establishment. That's how they make their money. They feed their orders to establish brokers who then make money on those trades by taking a little a little bit of the price.

[00:13:35]
So I think they are trying to make the market, but they're also trying to keep the fences up, make sure the rabble can't crash the party.

[00:13:44]
So then two questions. One, what does this tell us about Wall Street and the market and to what do we do to improve this because it feels like an unfair system?

[00:13:53]
Well, it is an unfair system. It's a deeply unfair system. And one of the things that make me suspicious about all this talk of democratizing the stock market is that the distribution of income and wealth is very undemocratic. And there's nothing that you can do about that, nothing that a trading platform can do to change any of that. I mean, the fundamentals of the society are not going to change because some people in red, it got to play in the stock market.

[00:14:16]
But what does it tell you about Wall Street? It is largely of little economic significance.

[00:14:23]
The standard story is that the stock market exists to raise money for productive corporations, to invest in capital equipment, buildings, hire people, do R&D.

[00:14:35]
It does almost none of that. The market really is more about extracting value from companies. For shareholders. It's it really is a machine for extracting value. For the top one percent of society, the ownership of stocks is extremely concentrated. Something like ninety five percent of all stocks are owned by the richest five percent. And, you know, if you guys aren't ready, they're really not going to change that fundamental fact.

[00:15:01]
So for those people who are on rent, it's, you know, for the people who came in because they liked that, you know, that GameStop got a new CEO. You know, those people who who actually wanted to invest, the people who said, I believe in a future or screw the hedge funds, what position they and now I mean, are they at risk of losing a lot of money now or are they in a position where they've made so much from the initial investment that if they get out, they're generally going to be fine?

[00:15:25]
Yeah, I think you're going to exit a position. You just can't start a new one, which is somewhat reasonable. OK, but, you know, I think some some people are going to really lose a lot of money if people who are sensible enough sold into this rally. You know, if you bought it at 50 or 100 and sold it three hundred or three hundred and fifty, you're doing pretty nicely. But just looking at the chart for trading in GameStop today, it was, you know, went from something like three hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty.

[00:15:51]
You know, during the course of the day, it's been an utterly crazy, wild ride. None none of it makes much sense at all. Now, I think a lot of people, however, are going to hold onto their positions hoping that, well, if it went to three fifty, you can go to a thousand. On Twitter today, somebody said to me, four thousand with eight or ten rocket emojis afterwards, this is the nature of bubbles.

[00:16:13]
You know, this larger issue here is that the entire stock market is in an epic bubble. I mean, it's really one of the great bubbles of all time. The market's only been valued this highly at a couple of previous times in history for 2000, at the peak of the dotcom bubble and 1929 before the great crash. So, you know where it's really crazy territory and things like. This is a sign that maybe things are just a little frothy, but, you know, I think there is that sense that when people get people who are new to the market get this deeply involved, it's kind of a sign that things are are ripening, shall we say.

[00:16:50]
There's a saying in Wall Street that a bear market is when money returns to its rightful owners.

[00:16:54]
And I think, you know, I don't know what's going to set off that bear market. Bubbles always go further than you think they could. There's certainly no rationality to this at all. But at some point, somebody is going to be left holding a very depleted bag.

[00:17:09]
Before I let you go, does the person who is holding the depleted bag determine how the situation is dealt with? So if the big players on Wall Street, if they're the ones holding the depleted bag, is it going to be dealt with differently from the government versus if, like the people on the ground are holding the depleted bag? Oh, absolutely.

[00:17:27]
There's nothing right now that we can see that would require any kind of government bailout. A couple of hedge funds may blow up, but nobody cares. There's no systemic risk around that. You know, much the worse for them.

[00:17:36]
But, you know, I think if some Wall Street people left, left, left, holding the bag, there may be some bail out if you know larger entities than just a few hedge funds to trouble. We'll have a government bailout. That's always what happens. Wall Street's quite an amazing game there. It's always this every 10, 15 years that seem to run into a wall and the government bailed them out. So, you know, they learn that they can get away with anything.

[00:18:05]
There's a famous story about Sonny Barger, the old Hells Angel who woke up from a coma after a motorcycle accident. And the nurse said to him, well, I hope you learned your lesson. Mr. Barger said, yes, I did. She said, what's that? He said, I can do anything and survive to that. Wall Street cultivates. They can do anything and survive. The only thing that would really change anything is if there is enough popular outrage.

[00:18:31]
That said, we really need to regulate this casino. Seriously, we didn't really have that serious set of reforms after the 2008 financial crisis. Right. You know. All right.

[00:18:41]
But not serious. It was not like the reforms that happened after twenty nine to thirty two.

[00:18:45]
So maybe, maybe, maybe if we see some kind of very serious mash up, we might finally wake up and have some kind of regulation of this business.

[00:18:55]
And Diane Wood, thank you so much for joining us on the show. I hope to see you again anytime. Thanks.

[00:19:01]
Don't forget, you can check out Dugs Radio Show behind the news wherever you get your podcasts. All right. When we come back, what would you get? Some advice on democracy from Africa. And Regina King is still joining us on the show.

[00:19:14]
Don't go away. Lancaster, South Carolina, is in the middle of not much, but growing up nearby. I knew it as the hometown of a black man named Jim Duncan, who became a Super Bowl hero after the of.

[00:19:28]
Now, my new podcasts return, man. I'll discover that his death still makes no sense at all.

[00:19:34]
The story was that my brother went to the police station, took a gun off a police officer and shot himself in the head. Most people don't believe that. For the past three years at the Rock Hill Herald, I looked back at a story that's timelier than ever breaking down. So have you got some time to talk?

[00:19:54]
It involves race, the mental state of the person and a child that was scared to death to say anything. Listen to return man on the I Heart radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast. If you took away the date and time, could you imagine that happening today? Yes, you can. Once you know who it is, D.J., scream Big Bang, checking in big facts has officially touched down on the black affect and I heart radio.

[00:20:23]
Now, bang, you know, big fix it for a week. Hardiman Today for the sensitive big, big fix, which I put it up about real topics, real situations. And of course, you know, we have no conversations with the biggest names in the culture. Twenty one Savage is on big fast giving up. What's up?

[00:20:43]
What's been going on with you when you get to a certain level, be like, I got out of college, you've got everything. How can I help my community and I outlive my people? No, I'm saying that you out of my and were staring at me like feel like you complete. I like you did your job and then bigger a big fat nothing is bigger than big facts. Make sure you listen to big facts on our radio app, on Apple podcast or whatever.

[00:21:06]
You get your podcasts. You know how we come. Welcome back to the daily social distancing show as the past few months have shown, America's government is a lot shakier than it appears. Luckily, though, there's a continent that can offer a lot of advice for unstable democracies. Roy Wood Jr. has more.

[00:21:32]
OK, so here in America, things have been pretty rough lately. Actually, it's been kind of terrible. OK, it's been a day of nightmares.

[00:21:41]
We actually had an armed coup. How do you come back from that to find out? I sat down with three political scholars, all from Africa, where they've actually seen this kind of shit before.

[00:21:53]
Problems of democracy, problems with dealing with election violence could actually happen anywhere. It could happen to everyone. And in the context of Africa, what has happened when violence follow elections, key leaders go into exile.

[00:22:06]
But Nathan Trunked got kicked off of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. The exile is happening. He can't even get on Etsy. You know how much of an asshole you got to be to be banned from class social exile.

[00:22:22]
But I think that there should be substantive punishment.

[00:22:25]
Krafts. That's right, Trump needs real punishment, and I know his supporters are saying, can we just let it go? Trump's gone. He waved and got on the helicopter like Godzilla going back into the sea at the end of the movie.

[00:22:41]
But it turns out that letting it go is exactly the wrong thing to do.

[00:22:46]
We may think that January 6th may be kind of this critical juncture where the unfathomable has happened and therefore we will do things differently and that usually doesn't happen. What happens is people will say, OK, it's time to heal and it's time to forget and move on and therefore never holding people accountable and never deconstructing the institution that allows such violations to take place.

[00:23:11]
That's how you stop racism. You have a terrible moment. And then at a sporting event, you have a moment of silence and then a month later, you act like this should never happen.

[00:23:21]
That is very dangerous, particularly the black squares on our Instagram.

[00:23:26]
Unfortunately, these experts say if we're going to avoid a Koopa do well, America is going to need a whole laundry list of constitutional amendments.

[00:23:34]
You need a universal voter's roll, a elections management body, building systems that are for the people, by the people working with the people to take a look at your security institutions, taking a look at the financing of politics, that's fine.

[00:23:53]
But we've got to keep the Electoral College write the electoral college exists in order to keep white southerners within the United States by empowering them so much that they would be able to maintain a system of segregation and pseudo slavery, the Electoral College.

[00:24:14]
I'm going to push back a little bit. The Electoral College was. Actually, the reason that the Electoral College was. It's got college in it, though, so it sounds smart. I'm sorry I'm in you respectfully. One analogy is rebuilding your house. Sometimes you have to gut the house, get the whole house.

[00:24:33]
Let me just get the property brothers to come in for a weekend. They knocked it out. You lost property, brothers.

[00:24:39]
You can try to paint the trim and you can change your countertop. But ultimately, there needs to be a moment of reckoning that sounds like this isn't the kind of thing to close on HDTV can fix in out.

[00:24:52]
It may be the worst fixer upper that we've ever seen.

[00:24:54]
There must be something we're doing. Right? Right.

[00:24:58]
The good thing of January six was the Georgia election results, and that is the result of decades of work and political mobilization and constituency building. And so if you replicate the work that created the Georgia result all over the United States, then, you know, there's possibly a good foundation to build from. That's the American dream. And the thing about the dream, though, is that you can't lie down and nap and expect it. You need to work first.

[00:25:35]
Yes, I get it.

[00:25:36]
I got to work for the American dream. I see now how annoying it is for someone to tell you that. Wow.

[00:25:42]
Which brings up one question. After all the bullshit that America has put African nations through, how good does it feel to look at the TV screen and tell America that they need to get their shit together?

[00:25:54]
It feels amazing. What's that German word?

[00:25:57]
Schadenfreude that Trump was referring to African countries as shithole countries. Now, tell me, who is that shithole country?

[00:26:05]
And it's my country you talk about. Well, do you see democracy's hard guys? It's not just hard for us. It's hard for you to say.

[00:26:12]
Well, America sounds like we've got our work cut out for us. Sorry. I mean, you have your work cut out for you.

[00:26:19]
I got a backup plan. How much to get one American citizenship passport joint.

[00:26:24]
Is that what you got out of this conversation? Single. Which one of y'all single? We can organize you an ancestral visa of some kind.

[00:26:31]
Oh, I'm out. We got to talk. No, I'm just leave America. That's the easiest thing to do. That's what we should have done.

[00:26:40]
Why don't you just tell me that in the first place, which I'm going to tell him about our local dysfunctions as well. Well, I mean, he's just.

[00:26:48]
Come on. What, y'all got wet? Nothing. It's very sunny. Welcome.

[00:26:56]
Thank you so much for that, Roy. All right. When we come back, Regina King is on the show to tell me about the night that Muhammad Ali, Sam Cooke, Jim Brown and Malcolm X all spent together.

[00:27:06]
You don't want to miss it. Hey, guys, Ben, Ben is here and I'm the creator of a crazy little show called Markinson Concern for Comedy Central Digital. And I'm Christopher Hitchens, plus the voice of Clarkson, whose name is well, son, we made this insane show at the studio that makes robot chicken.

[00:27:19]
Markinson is a mixed media puppet show that follows an overly manly father named Blac, who desperately tries to connect with his overly nerdy son.

[00:27:26]
He got some really cool people involved just in Royal and Donald Faison, Jane Lynch, Jim Rash, Deborah Baker, Jr.. It's going to be crazy. So roll your fingers out of bed and peep the season two premiere January 30th on Comedy Central's YouTube channel.

[00:27:38]
Check it out. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. So earlier today, I spoke with Oscar winning actor Regina King. She just directed her first feature film, One Night in Miami, about the night that Muhammad Ali, Sam Cooke, Jim Brown and Malcolm X spent together. We talked about that and more. Regina King, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:28:04]
MAN Hi, Trever. Hi, how are you?

[00:28:09]
I you know, I'm I am I am just trying to begin with the win.

[00:28:13]
Right. Right. I feel like that's that's the motto of your life. Ever since I've had the pleasure of knowing you from afar as a person and then being able to stand next to you while you're holding golden awards at award shows, you have always seemed like somebody who goes, I'm doing what I can do, you know, defined by the circumstances that I'm limited to. But I'm just going to keep doing what I can do and man, have you been doing it?

[00:28:38]
Well, thank you.

[00:28:39]
But yeah, that is kind of my motto. I'm just doing my best.

[00:28:43]
Doing your best is an understatement. Regina, you have an Oscar, you have a Golden Globe, you have a record full primetime Emmy Awards. You are doing more than everyone's best, in my opinion. And now you're stepping into the world of directing in a major way. Most people direct and we don't know that they're directing. You stepped in and already people are saying, man, this this film could be in the world of Oscars. Before we talk about the buzz, let's talk about the story one night in Miami for legends.

[00:29:13]
What did you think that you could tell in the story that would just give us, I guess, a reimagining of who all these people are?

[00:29:19]
Yeah, I think more than anything, for me, while we know that this might actually happen, the conversations are imagined by Kim Powers, who wrote the script, who is an amazing writer, who also co-wrote and directed Soul. So he's he's kind of out there making big things happen. But I think for me, it was that he put conversations that are conversations that black people, black men have been having for so long into the mouths of these larger than life men.

[00:29:55]
Right. Who we know just throughout interviews definitely have these opinions that are expressed in our film. So I just for me, I was like, wow, to be able to humanize them in a way that they are speaking for so many men. It just it was just grabbed me, just jumped out off the page at me.

[00:30:22]
Yeah. I mean, you've made a film about people who each have a film about their own lives.

[00:30:28]
That's how powerful and momentous their existence was on this planet. You know, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, all in one room on one night, having a conversation about their visions for the future and the way they see the world in the way they see life. Now, I know that this was this was also a play. And I know that taking a play and turning it into a film can often be a really daunting task because, you know, a play has everyone there sitting in one place.

[00:30:55]
And you don't have to do much because that's that's the the forum. That's the platform you have to direct to make one space feel like it's going somewhere. Talk me through some of those challenges and how you how you thought about making a movie that doesn't go anywhere and yet takes us everywhere.

[00:31:13]
Well, I think the dialogue was star of the film to me and so did all of that heavy lifting. And I just always felt like the right actors, powerful actors who really understood what they were taking on would be half the battle right there. And then from there, just I wanted to get out of the way of of of the story. Like, sure, I wanted it to be a visual experience, but not so much that the camera would distract.

[00:31:48]
So, yeah, just lots of conversations and preparation ahead of time to just allow the dialogue to be the star and allow everything else to just kind of create all that dialogue and just allow the audience to sit there in it and be be there with these men.

[00:32:08]
One of the things I've truly appreciated about you throughout your career is that you are an artist. There's no denying, though, that you are also a trailblazer. You know, this movie was the first movie by an African-American woman director to get into the Venice Film Festival, which seems crazy. I mean, it's twenty, twenty one now. But this was the first time that that ever happened. And so I'm sure a lot of people look at you and go like, man, OK, you you making films now for all the black women.

[00:32:35]
And you you you succeed for all black women and you feel for all black women. How are you a. To create creatively without stressing about that burden that you can feel, you know, some sections of society putting on you, whether it's the media or whoever it may be going like Regina, you do this for every black woman or you fail for every black woman.

[00:32:53]
Yeah. I mean, it's it's kind of like always a dance because it's very easy to just get consumed with that energy or that narrative that it does exist. And I mean, it is true. I mean, we don't get the opportunity as black people to fill up if we mess up, know that's pretty much it. Usually we don't get another chance. So I do recognize that.

[00:33:22]
And sometimes it does feel like it feels kind of weighty. Sometimes I speak to other people that I know feel the same way, but in that I feel like God wouldn't have brought me to it if I wasn't going to get through it. So I know that I must have been designed for this moment. So I'm figuring it out along the way when those anxious moments come. And in all actuality, I'm still always getting inspiration from from all over.

[00:33:56]
I mean, like just I just got introduced to this 14 year old girl. I think her name is Kayla Love Jones, who did her first short. And it's in the Pan African Film Festival in the Urban World Film Festival. And that is inspiring to me. You know, it's like I I'm just always. Trying to plug in wherever I can plug in and in and pick up some some energy to keep the trajectory being an upward one and not the lateral.

[00:34:34]
I've said this to you before, and I'll say it again. I don't know how you stay as humble as you are with all the gold trophies you have. I would have all the trophies in my car all the time and I'll just be cutting people off, holding trophies out the window if anybody said anything, because you truly are a legend who is still living. And we're excited for the next chapter of your journey, which is directing Regina King. Thank you so much for joining me on the show.

[00:34:54]
I appreciate you. Trevor Noah.

[00:34:59]
Don't forget, one night in Miami is available right now on Amazon Prime. Are we going to take a quick break? But we'll be right back after this.

[00:35:07]
Okay, so we're supposed to be sticking to the script, but we ain't because this is not what we do is you go out and bam. Yeah, and it's AJ Hey. And we're giving a whole bunch of good, bad advice and a lot of bad redivert trying to teach you how to say when, how and how much. Yes. Now, that doesn't always have to apply to your sex life, ladies. It can absolutely apply to your career unless your sex life is your career and it is changeable.

[00:35:38]
We're talking about a whole lot of said what I love to say and A, then love the money and relationship and we're going to work on that.

[00:35:51]

[00:36:01]
I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards. And it could happen here. And boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.

[00:36:44]
The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you listen to podcasts. Well, that's our show for tonight, but before we go, I wanted to remind you that the coronavirus is as bad as it has ever been and our first responders are out there fighting to save people's lives.

[00:37:11]
Now, if you can help these first responders out in any way, then please consider a donation to first responders first, which offers first class medical and psychological treatment for the first responders themselves.
