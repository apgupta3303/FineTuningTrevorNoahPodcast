You've heard the news, Donald Trump is on fire, Donald Trump fresh off a landslide victory in New Hampshire.

[00:00:45]
His success has baffled the mainstream media, but it turns out the secret to Trump has been right under their noses the whole time.

[00:00:52]
This is a circus, unlike anything that we have seen in modern American politics is the greatest show on earth. He's the greatest show on earth.

[00:00:59]
Now, if you want to understand the circus that is Donald Trump, don't ask these idiots. Ask the guy with a sword down his throat, a circus performer, Adam, real man.

[00:01:08]
People like the danger element of a circus in a sideshow. You know, when the lion tamer sticks his head in the lion's mouth. Tell me you want a sea lion, just chop his head off.

[00:01:20]
Yeah. The audience, I think, always wants to know that this stuff is real and it is real.

[00:01:25]
We're watching a loaded gun on stage and it could go off at any moment and say Mexicans are rapists, boom. It could say anything.

[00:01:32]
So there's a dangerous Mexicans are rapists.

[00:01:35]
OK, so maybe he hasn't been to many Trump events, but real man taught me that the greatest show must have a ring leader who can work a crowd got to give Lincoln the pitch.

[00:01:44]
You have to impress them. You've got to impress your crowd. Exactly. Your poll numbers that superhigh. Correct?

[00:01:50]
I'm leading every poll nationwide. You're the best. That's it. Best businessman you've ever seen. Yes, I make great deals. Look at this show. This is the greatest show on earth. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going. Hey, let's bring out the snake charmer. We bring out the snake charmer. You bring Paillot out, OK?

[00:02:06]
You betcha. Has to be something an audience will want to see. But I had a good old time. You bought a hat. I want to see this freak again. Exactly.

[00:02:14]
This guy got it. Trump really is the greatest show on Earth, right, Adam?

[00:02:18]
Well, you know, by calling him the greatest show on Earth, you're kind of insulting a lot of the circus world.

[00:02:26]
OK, regardless, I had to see Trump up close, so I headed to one of his rallies and got to hear from some diehard trumpeter's.

[00:02:34]
I think he's the only candidate on the Republican side who's actually going to build a wall and who's going to make him pay for it. He's gonna make China and, you know, people say, oh, you can't make China pay for it. You know, as much horse crap. It's pretty easy to make China pay for it.

[00:02:45]
China will be paying for the wall for Mexico. Pay for the wall. Oh, Mexico. Sorry.

[00:02:51]
You know, it isn't one of the countries without one of those countries is paying for that. Well, Donald Trump is inaugurated. He becomes the United States. What's behind that curtain?

[00:03:01]
Take one of my definition of ISIS deficient ISIS. What should we do to ISIS?

[00:03:06]
Bomb them? Where officially should we bomb ISIS? Probably like Israel area, but not like not necessarily there, but around the area, I think is going to help with the ISIS. What's he going to do with the ISIS? He can't tell us right now. If he tells everybody, then the next thing you know, somebody else is going to copy what he says.

[00:03:25]
They knew there Trump once I was under the big top, we were all grooving to Trump's power playlist, which included tiny dancer like eight times.

[00:03:35]
Finally, there he was. And he wasted no time shining the spotlight on the main event himself. Takes guts to run for president. Believe me, no one in the polls every single week. I've been on the cover of Time magazine so much lately. When I was on last week, I didn't even know they were putting away the government. Can you imagine? That's when you're really hitting it big.

[00:03:55]
He made the audience recoil at the freak show. Looking back there, look at the press. Turn around and look at these people. Look at. They start booing, he whipped the crowd into a frenzy with a high wire act of political incorrectness. She said he's a pussy. That's go. And then something strange happened, whether just something that's going to be whether you like Dwight Eisenhower no matter what you do, Dwight Eisenhower. I like that everybody said he started to meander.

[00:04:29]
I just asked for tickets. I wanted tickets for the post office in Washington, D.C. I think people got bored. It's an incredible building.

[00:04:38]
But then, like any great showman, he pulled them back in with his greatest routine, a feat of xenophobic strain. Who the hell is going to pay for the wall? A classic bit Trump had delivered and I laughed, I cried, I reinvigorated my irrational fear of foreigners. I even jockeyed for selfies with a couple of reality TV star Donald Joe. Joe Cocker vile. Got it, a memory that will last for possibly four years. God help us all.

[00:05:24]
What was America's last great for me, I would say the turning point for our country was 1913 when we passed the 17th Amendment. And what's the like back when, like women couldn't vote? Yeah, well, back open again. Like that family. That's got your sweet spot right there. Absolutely. But 1913, what year was America? Great.

[00:05:46]
When it was founded, so for the slavery stuff, except for the slavery stuff, you know, I think we were probably our strongest immediately post-war war to go around the 1950's, mid 40s, 50s.

[00:06:02]
I mean, I think the 50s was great other than, you know, segregation and women's rights.

[00:06:08]
Look, we could we could sit here and paint negative, right. Faces of all times in America. Correct. It's make America great again. So when was the last great? It's always been great. So we're so if it's always been great, what are we trying to go back to? We're not going back. We're going forward.

[00:06:25]
Well, I guess the 80s were pretty good. All right. The 80s, 80s, great music. Crack cocaine. Crack cocaine.

[00:06:32]
Yeah, well, we're always great. The people are great. So, yeah, that's what America is great right now. So we did it. No, we didn't do it. America became became great when the founding fathers put pen and paper in 1776 and decided to build a country based on laws. That was greatness. That was awesome. Other than slavery, obviously that was trouble. And we didn't have that yet. We did have that slave and the Indian thing.

[00:06:56]
Right. That was terrible and the women's voting thing. But other than that, that was awesome. A few hiccups along the way, you know, like like they say, you know, nobody made it to the top without breaking a few pieces of China. That wasn't an insult, by the way. Donald Trump's new ideological screening test will weed out extremists with extreme views about religion, such as its oppression of women, gays and nonbelievers.

[00:07:29]
That's right. Trump wants prospective Americans to embrace religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights. At a recent rally in Wisconsin, his fans were on board. I am for extreme vetting. I am. I think it is a good idea. Extreme vetting. That's a good idea.

[00:07:44]
Of course, he forgot one thing. Just make him eat some bacon.

[00:07:47]
These guys were pumped about America's values of tolerance, so I knew they'd passed Trump's test with flying colors.

[00:07:54]
Fill in the blank for me. Two men getting married is blank. Disgusting.

[00:08:00]
Actually, the answer is legal in the United States. It's legal, but I don't like it.

[00:08:04]
It's important to believe in, you know, to have respect for everyone's religion. So you respect Christianity? I do. Judaism, yes.

[00:08:13]
Islam. No one may be president. The presidency is a man's job.

[00:08:18]
I have women are qualified to be president.

[00:08:20]
Know a female has more hormones. She could start a war in ten seconds if she has hot flashes, whatever. Boom.

[00:08:29]
Haven't all wars been started by men?

[00:08:35]
Yes. Do you think a gay couple should have the same rights as a. No, I don't. I really don't. I don't think it's fair to the gay couple.

[00:08:44]
Well, no, but the regular couple, they worked so hard, you know, and the gay couple, they want more.

[00:08:52]
Do you? When you say more, do you mean equal? Yeah, they want equal.

[00:08:56]
And that's just too much. Yeah. That's the wrong answer. Sorry, hold on. Turns out Trumps ideology test was going to be harder than I thought.

[00:09:06]
Whenever I hear president, I think of man, it's a man's job. What? I may be a close minded.

[00:09:13]
No. Yeah. Well, no.

[00:09:17]
Misogynistic.

[00:09:19]
No. You're voting against your own interests. That's it. Thank you very much.

[00:09:23]
These extreme nations, they don't they don't treat women with respect. We treat women with respect here. Yes, we do. That's an American ideal. Yeah. Tell me about your shirt.

[00:09:31]
What's it say? It says Hillary sucks, but not like Monica.

[00:09:38]
Hilarious. So we were talking about treating women with respect.

[00:09:41]
It's an American ideal that we treat women with respect. You got to give me the backlash here one more time. That's too much fun.

[00:09:48]
Trump that because we don't even see the irony in it.

[00:09:53]
I love it. Right. As passionate as these guys were, they just weren't passing Trump's ideological test. Luckily, there was still time to study. This will just help you prep for the test. So if you take it again, you'll be more welcome here. This is a DVD of the third season of Will and Grace. OK, it's a really likable and not to gay gay people. This one is going to be good for you, Gloria Steinem.

[00:10:19]
This really humanizes women because as feminists, we have so much work to be done. You know, you're a feminist. No, obviously, extreme vetting was necessary to weed out extremists. But until this plan was in place where any of us safe, are you afraid the extremists are already here right now?

[00:10:38]
They could be anywhere right here. They could be, yeah.

[00:10:41]
They could be over there with that guy or this guy. Could be anybody.

[00:10:45]
Could be anybody. This past summer, Trump flag wavers spouted a lot of theories about Hillary Clinton's health. We see the coughing fits, but she's had, it seems like a number of blood clots.

[00:10:58]
What on earth could be the reason behind Hillary Clinton's bizarre behavior?

[00:11:03]
Look, it almost seems seizure risk to me.

[00:11:06]
Turns out they were sort of right. We're now learning she's been diagnosed with pneumonia. If the crackpots halfway nailed one theory, maybe their truth fingers were in deeper than mine.

[00:11:16]
I had to find out. I had to go to Trump. Rallies in the crucial swing states of Ohio and Wisconsin to discover what his supporters know that the rest of us don't. Do you think it's worse than pneumonia and the way she looks?

[00:11:29]
Yes. What do you think is going on? It could be Parkinson's. It could be M.S., it could be AIDS. What makes you think she has AIDS? Her husband used to be. So you think Bill had AIDS? Yes. So how did Bill Clinton get AIDS? Probably messing around with Magic Johnson. That's the natural conclusion. Yes, interesting, the Clintons and Magic Johnson. What else do they know?

[00:11:54]
They're saying there's like a double of her. Do you think there was a Hillary Clinton double? Yeah, I think anything's possible when it comes to doubles. Wow.

[00:12:02]
A Clinton double. Who knew? So I printed out two identical photos to see if they could see what we couldn't.

[00:12:09]
And which one's the body double for that one. Oh, what is it about this one that makes you think it's not Hillary Clinton that a little thing on her cheek is very obvious.

[00:12:17]
And this kind of scarring or whatever this is down on her throat is different.

[00:12:21]
They look a ton alike, right? This looks a little bit younger. Do you think this looks younger? Yeah, but don't you think if you just look at something for long enough and you kind of have a paranoid mind, eventually you'll find a difference maker?

[00:12:31]
I think something like that's possible, yeah.

[00:12:34]
Which would be more attractive to people. Oh, yeah.

[00:12:39]
Uncovering Hillary's doubles is one thing, but what could they tell us about our current commander in chief, Barack Obama?

[00:12:45]
As a Muslim? He's a terrorist. Nobody will ever tell me different or even know if his addresses and if you if you don't look at the birth certificate, there's almost no evidence there. Exactly.

[00:12:55]
So there's nothing Barack Obama could do to prove that he was born here if there was maybe witnesses that were attendance at his birth like his mother. Would you listen to the mother now? Now she has motivation to lie. Do you don't trust Donald Trump's birth certificate either?

[00:13:10]
Yeah, because he's been here forever. How do you know? But how do you what's your proof? Well, his parents and I know, but they're biased. I'm talking about people who could be biased. Well, like, I'm just using your logic against you. OK.

[00:13:23]
He acts like a Muslim. He talks like a Muslim. He also does the Muslim principles as far as jewelry is concerned. Jewelry. Yeah, jewelry. Certain months of the year not wearing his wedding ring.

[00:13:35]
That's that's that's a deep cut. You want me to connect your necklace to your Christianity? Why would you do that? Well, you just taught me and I didn't even know people were connecting jewelry to religion. Muslims don't wear a Jew watch.

[00:13:49]
And one of the most unbelievable discoveries yet, Barack Obama had a big part of 9/11.

[00:13:55]
Which part? Not being around, always on vacation, never in the office.

[00:13:59]
Why do you think Barack Obama wasn't in the Oval Office on 9/11? That, I don't know, like to get to the bottom of that.

[00:14:06]
Wow. Mind blown. They also had new truths about the media cover up of Trump's surging popularity.

[00:14:13]
I don't think the media really portrays all the African-Americans to support Donald Trump.

[00:14:18]
So what should we be portraying? Where are these African-Americans?

[00:14:25]
When you literally look out across the 400, 500 people here, we don't see any way, way white people. Yeah, it's like a Dave Matthews concert, except Dave Matthews actually has African-Americans in his band. Tell me when you see somebody who is not white here.

[00:14:43]
Right here. Thank you, brother. Donald Trump. I don't even know how much a loaf of bread or a dozen eggs. So you don't you're not even supporting Donald Trump? No. OK, so he didn't work.

[00:14:54]
Turns out they got one wrong, but the rest of their theories can be backed up with ironclad sources.

[00:14:59]
And what's your source?

[00:15:01]
Just Facebook or Twitter? I mean, everything. And I feel like I like facts. And you put it all together. Exactly. So outside of having no proof.

[00:15:09]
What proof do you have? I don't even have any opinion. Your opinion?

[00:15:14]
Do I have proof? No. Do I have articles? No. But your mind is made up without any information.

[00:15:19]
My mind is made up good enough for me. According to the mainstream media, Donald Trump's lewd talk and recent sexual assault allegations are eroding his Republican support.

[00:15:34]
The GOP is abandoning their nominee in droves.

[00:15:38]
The exodus of Republican support continued. Republicans are deserting the sinking ship. But I don't listen to that noise. I listen to this throb.

[00:15:47]
Bah bah bah bah. This is Jordan Klepper. Fingers the pulse. I hitched a ride to a rally in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania to ask Trump supporters if he had finally crossed the line. You know what?

[00:16:04]
So what if he wants to grant Putsy? I want to grant Poissy. That's a no. I wish I could grab as much pussy as he is.

[00:16:13]
Well, I'd like to grab Okita by a push and shove some Yankee Doodle Dandy right up your chest.

[00:16:19]
Also a no. But how were they OK with a presidential candidate bragging about sexual assault?

[00:16:24]
Wait for it I think is just locker room talk that really what does that guys in the bar talk that way when they see a pretty girl. What are going to say?

[00:16:31]
I've heard worse about men talking about girls, women.

[00:16:35]
So are they are you talking about other like presidential candidates like Mondale? Yes. Locker room talk. That's what boys do. He didn't do it. Well, I don't I don't talk like that. Well, do you have any children? I joke. Do they talk like that? No, they don't. Not those boys. Well, no. No, I don't. Does he talk like that? No. No. That boy. No. Is that how you talk?

[00:16:54]
Well, no. But I feel like he he says how your dad talks, you know, but your pastor talks. No, not to.

[00:17:00]
Who talks like that? Well, obviously, Donald Trump I was stupid bragging mentor.

[00:17:06]
Men brag. We brag. Right. You brag a bit, right? I'm not exactly. But I know quite a few people that do. And background. Dabb Yes. It was all becoming clear. Men brag. It's just locker room talk gravel y you can trump. What is it.

[00:17:24]
They're grab it away again. I thought I can't talk like in front of my daughter. You just did things you say people can hear and the locker room was huge extending all the way across the country. Was there any line Trump couldn't cross? Is there anything Trump could say that could come on up that would make you never know, no matter what he says or does?

[00:17:48]
I will vote for Donald Trump. If he said the N word, would you still vote for him? It wouldn't be right, but I would still vote for him.

[00:17:54]
What if he said everybody should go little pigs with that? Would you still vote for him?

[00:17:59]
That I would still vote for him? Yes. Wow. The media's fingers. We're nowhere near the polls. They have gotten it wrong. People here knew Trump's comments weren't sexual assault. They were something completely different. Just ask this man who conducted a highly scientific survey.

[00:18:16]
Carducci, I asked a lot of women here at half of them would love to have their pussy snatched right by Trump. I got news for you. That is news to me.

[00:18:23]
One man's sexual assault is another man's flirtation. You must be quite the charmer with the ladies. I used to be.

[00:18:31]
You know, I got the ring now. One of them landed me. She even squeezed it. So I can't get it off because she sort of I took it off once and it was a little mark there. So she's no dummy.

[00:18:39]
Oh, well, I think she's a dummy if she thinks somebody else is going to do. Sorry, bro. Just a little bit of locker room talk. This has been a divisive nightmare of an election, but in the spirit of moving forward, at one of the debates, the candidates themselves took an opportunity to say one positive thing about each other. I hitched a ride to a Trump rally to see if his supporters were also ready to rise above the anger and reach out to the other side.

[00:19:09]
And you say one nice thing about Hillary Clinton. Not really. Not no. Not one.

[00:19:15]
No, no. I have absolutely nothing nice to say about Hillary Clinton. What about people who support Hillary? I think they're idiots. No, I.

[00:19:22]
I'm sorry. I'd like to be a gentleman and say, yes, you get a nice kid, but she's a nice kid, right. I guess she hasn't proven herself to be guilty of anything yet. I'm sorry, Jordan. What can I tell you?

[00:19:34]
Obama, me, the man. Wow. That was depressing. So I headed to a Hillary rally. Surely her supporters would live up to their slogan of stronger together and teach those hateful Trump voters a thing or two about kindness. What do you like about Donald Trump?

[00:19:49]
Nothing. He's an asshole. Is there any good thing about Donald Trump that you could say? No, no, no. I'll give you time. OK, let me think.

[00:20:00]
No, you don't really think. Oh, yes. All right. No, you didn't. You changed your hair a little bit and then you said the same thing. He has an economic background.

[00:20:08]
OK, whether he can put it into a plan that will suit our nation, I don't know.

[00:20:13]
You don't stop. The first part was a nice compliment. You weren't loved. And that is the nice.

[00:20:23]
So both camps have a ways to go. Maybe they just needed a little push.

[00:20:28]
What if I gave you two dollars and you say something nice about Hillary Clinton? What if I gave you ten dollars? No. What if I told you it will help our society to put aside your partisanship and actually say something kind about somebody that half the country supports, not Hillary? I no.

[00:20:44]
No. OK, how about this? Democrats like expressing their feelings. Maybe that was the way it we're going to do I feel statement. Talk to Donald Trump. I want you to say when you blank, I feel blank.

[00:20:57]
When you say grab her by the pussy, I feel like a disrespected woman. OK, that's good.

[00:21:02]
When you say let's build a wall, I say let's build you into the wall because see what you did right there, you didn't feel what you did is you use that as an opportunity to be negative. Mm hmm. Now, that's something, you know, who would do something like that? Donald Trump, don't do this.

[00:21:14]
This wasn't working. I couldn't unite the people. Maybe I could unite their slogans. Wait, no, that's not it. Good. OK, better that can work.

[00:21:24]
Make a man make America stronger together, get clunky. But it a couple of works. Make America stronger together again. A little bit of both. Trump way to move forward. OK, let's trying to move us forward. Make America stronger together again. A little bit of both. You know what, it's bullet for Hillary. I don't think it's for us coming together. We'll be together. We're bound up in hell.

[00:21:51]
But then just when I gave up hope, I finally heard it. That one positive thing.

[00:21:57]
OK, well, there's got to be something good about Donald Trump. It's come over. Pretend your husband is Hillary Clinton. Say something nice. I like your hair. I mean, his hair is hilarious.

[00:22:07]
His hair is real nice hair. So if there's one thing we can all rally around as a country, it's great hair. God bless America. Not even a month since the campaign ended with victory. Donald Trump was getting the band back together again for something. The president elect planning to visit those states that helped him secure a win for the White House.

[00:22:32]
A Trump victory tour, a victory tour. Now, they tell us they want us to call it a thank you tour. They're calling it a victory tour. I mean, I don't think we've ever seen that before, calling it a thank you tourist. Right.

[00:22:43]
No one in the media or Trump's camp seems to know exactly what this event is. So I went to Cincinnati to find out what is this?

[00:22:52]
We know what we've got a bunch of people who are really excited about Trump. They said we're going to get tired of winning. We're not tired. He wants to let the people know that things are still going on. The stuff that he was still campaigning about, he's still going on.

[00:23:03]
I mean, it's it is it's obvious if he doesn't know when the campaign ends. That's right. What is it? Again, it's a victory to take another lap, right? Yeah. My one on how many of these rallies do you think you'll see in the first hundred days? I'm going to go with 15 because like the never ending to a never ending tour, we don't have to do it anywhere. We can just party all the time, all day long, all day long.

[00:23:27]
Someone going to run the country? Yeah, well, I just think the Trump matter is our president from Apprentice, the president. I love Ivanka Trump. It's incredible how you want to blow your brains out. It's so mind boggling neck. Jesus was right. This was a hell of a bash. While Trump has changed his tune on things like locking up Hillary and draining the swamp, these people were party like it was October twenty sixteen. They had their signs in their background tabs and they knew the lyrics to all the hits.

[00:24:04]
We're ready, we're ready. Yeah, build a wall, build a ball, drain the swamp, lock her up. We're going to lock her up, of course. Of course. Now, some people are saying she's a good person, should be prosecuted. They're liars. Well, that person is Donald Trump. That's wrong. At least we know Donald Trump's not going to stand for having Hillary's elitist New York bankers anywhere near the government.

[00:24:26]
None of the books except for bringing in some billionaire bankers.

[00:24:31]
It's going to happen. It's going to. Yeah, sure. Sure.

[00:24:32]
It's a some of them, I'm sure the Goldman Sachs guy, I mean, that is the swamp we want to drain. Sure. But also make secretary of the Treasury. Oh, yeah. The swamp will be drained.

[00:24:44]
Now, he does have people like Steve Manoogian who wants Goldman Sachs got to fill the swamp. You got to yeah. There's parts of the swamp. They're going to come in.

[00:24:50]
There's parts of the swamp that, you know, that's just not as catchy to say. So yeah, it's not. Yeah.

[00:24:54]
Don't you want the most qualified person, even though it might be a so-called, you know, swamp member, lobbyist or whatnot, that not the best thing to do. Somebody who's the most qualified for the job has the most experience, even if some of their background is suspect, that's the person who should have that job. That's right. A common sense way of looking at things. And that was, I think, Hillary Clinton's entire platform. The point is, instead of spending time learning how to run the country or following through on campaign promises, having a rally like this just feels so good.

[00:25:26]
The bottom line is we want to win big. I love you to look at this place. You're going to be happy, we're all going to be happy. And I was finally starting to see exactly what this was. It was a big, self-congratulatory pleasure fest in the round.

[00:25:46]
This is kind of our triumph. And so you guys wanted to, like, kind of get together in a big circular area and just kind of help each other release some of the tension and celebrate. Yes. Yes, exactly. It's important for you guys to just all come together at the same time. It's it's community. Yeah. It's a circlejerk, if you want to call it that. Sure. Yeah, it's a circlejerk. Well, good talking to you.

[00:26:11]
Just get ready, America. Your forearms are going to be you. Four years ago, I hit the streets to get the unfiltered truth from America's most engaged voters, trump that much. We don't even see the irony in it. Now we're heading into an historic election and I'm excited to get out into America and embed myself in the middle of the campaign trail. First up, rain soaked Hershey, Pennsylvania, but even Mother Nature couldn't dampen our spirits.

[00:26:43]
It's eight hours before Donald Trump arrives. It's raining and there are people here as it got good to see.

[00:26:50]
You can see I get guys excited when you're running for Congress. I bet you are. Good luck. Anybody can do it. A lot of familiar faces. Doris, Carol. Nice to be out there amongst my people once more. Let's go, guys. And here we go again.

[00:27:19]
Since my last Trump rally, there have been roughly 37 Marvel movies and one very combative impeachment trial, but what else has changed?

[00:27:27]
So what's new this season and everything? Honestly, we got this baby go to great America.

[00:27:34]
Keep watching it. It sounds like something Donald Trump would say or Yoda. I suppose they have very similar syntax. We're not all great speakers. Do you have any trump that bitch?

[00:27:44]
You don't have to know anything that's at all aimed at women, not for women, at women. What are you hoping for tonight?

[00:27:51]
I'm hoping Donald Trump is just in a good, good place of mine right now. I hope he talks about immigration. You're hoping for a better one? I'm hoping for a wall. Who's going to pay for it? He's going to pay for it. I say that's what we're going to find out. He's going to be taxpayer money. So maybe that's the who's going to pay for it. That's what we're going to find out about. Yeah. Why are you here?

[00:28:08]
Well, because two weeks ago I had a dream. And in that dream I was given this vision, this you had a screen printing dream. Your dream told you that Trump is going to win and then Ivanka and then Don Jr. and Eric Tippity is going to win in 2014. And then Baron. Great. All right. But it only serves one term. Oh, no, no. That's only one term. That's four years. Yeah. Actually, these are mostly one term president.

[00:28:35]
Oh, you're not reading it. Right, right.

[00:28:37]
No, I know this is one twenty four to twenty eight. That's more years and then another four.

[00:28:43]
No, no, no. That's, these are one term presidents ivonka one term Don Jr one term paper.

[00:28:48]
Ivanka what's what's the name. Ivonka is two thousand twenty four and two thousand twenty eight. That's eight years. That's four years.

[00:28:54]
You have a four year period. You, somebody else gets it right. It doesn't say anything about re-elected. Sanchez has her getting elected in twenty twenty four and twenty twenty method right now.

[00:29:04]
My math is that of course these rallies aren't just about spirited debate. It's also an opportunity for Trump supporters to clarify their message. In one word descriptor. Joe Biden, Dickless Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Warren scummy. Bernie Sanders Bolshevik. He Boutiette. Yeah, it's just a joke with the punch line. Who and trying to be politically correct here. But you know what I said. But I thought the word you're going to pick was vet people to judge people.

[00:29:38]
But that's two words. And I can't say the whole thing on camera. What's the whole thing? People will be, oh, it's homophobic.

[00:29:46]
That's why you can't say homophobia aside, there was one big new thing hanging over this rally, the impeachment.

[00:29:52]
What do you think about this impeachment bullshit? Well, shit. Why is it bullshit? Why? Because he didn't do anything.

[00:29:59]
It's bullshit. It's bullshit. Total bullshit. It's total nonsense.

[00:30:02]
And Trump has been grooming his supporters to push back on any impeachment talk.

[00:30:06]
With this simple demand, all you have to do is read the transcript, read the transcript, read the transcript. It's all about the transcript. Read the transcript. Right here is the transcript. I have not read it, but we should read the transcript. We should look at the transcript. Yeah, look at the transcript. Have you read the transcript? I trust the way I read the transcript, right? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Did you read the transcript?

[00:30:31]
I, I, I mean, I've read most of it, but there's nothing in the transcript. Yeah. I don't have time for, you know, reading all the, you know, impeachment, all that bullshit, you know. But how long have you been waiting out here for Donald Trump. Since 8:00 hours. A lot of free time. Absolutely.

[00:30:49]
I read the transcript. I read the transcript. Yeah. Did you read the transcript? I don't have to please everyone else. I can read it if I need to. But it's important that everybody reads the transcript. It is very important. Pay attention and think for yourself. Yes, you have.

[00:31:03]
But to be clear, you have not read the trades. I have it right. But it is just important. Yeah, yeah. Don't be a sheep. Think for yourself. But again, just to be very clear, you have not read. I have not read it. You just trusted somebody else. Right. What are you saying about don't be achieved or you think for yourself, do your own research. Do your research right. Don't be a sheep.

[00:31:22]
It was a message. These people who were being herded through gates and corralled into pens to then be guarded over by men on horses knew all too well. These totally not sheep are ready for eleven more months of this, whatever this is, and so am I. Campaign twenty twenty. Here we go again.

[00:33:23]
Last week, I went to tropical Iowa again, and while all eyes there have been on the Democratic candidates, a certain recently impeached former reality TV star showed up in town to get his own cup of Iowa.

[00:33:36]
Nice try. Just awesome and love, Maggie.

[00:33:44]
Oh, yeah. I've had nightmares that should've been to a Trump rally before. No, sir. What are your expectations? Truth. Truth at a Trump rally. Yeah. Good luck. However, all anyone's been talking about is the impeachment.

[00:33:59]
And while 69 percent of Americans wanted to hear from witnesses like John Bolton said Republicans wouldn't allow it. So what did these folks think of the trial as it nears its end? I think the impeachment trial itself is a joke, period. It's a shit show.

[00:34:15]
We think it's a complete sham. He hasn't done anything wrong. How did we get here? With no evidence? He didn't do anything. He didn't do anything more. Well said. Right. He didn't do anything. He didn't do. And so we should let everybody testify, correct? Oh. Oh, yeah. No, no, no.

[00:34:32]
Do you think John Bolton should testify? No. Why not? Or he could testify. But I think he's vengeful for getting fired from his job. I think he's a liar. John Bolton, liar. Absolutely.

[00:34:42]
There should be a system set up where he takes an oath and then under oath, he tells the truth. Otherwise, he's punished. I think there should be, yes.

[00:34:49]
And maybe there's a judge was put in charge like the highest judge in the last. Right, appointed by a Republican. And then we could all see what he has to say. Would you be for a system like that? Sure.

[00:34:59]
Well, they seem to want firsthand information from witnesses. They definitely didn't want witnesses with firsthand information. Regardless, they're sticking to Trump's favorite old defense.

[00:35:10]
I've read the transcript for four, but not verbatim. But I've read the transcript meaning like I've watched everybody read it on the news.

[00:35:17]
I haven't seen the chance. You know, that's not what reading the transcript means. But you watch people read it, right?

[00:35:22]
I haven't personally read the transcript. Have you read the transcript? No, I have the spoiler alert.

[00:35:28]
He asked a foreign country to interfere in our election.

[00:35:32]
It's crazy, right? Reagan You know what? I've explored this one before, but luckily, Trump has two or five new airtight legal defenses.

[00:35:42]
There's no whatever that word is, quid pro quo.

[00:35:46]
While it's a cold, it's hard to say. Right. It's even even harder to convince other people that inhabit new word.

[00:35:51]
I just learn. Yeah, there's no crime that's been there is a crime that he's been accused of. What does that mean? What what? What do you mean?

[00:36:01]
They're not making an accusation or brought an actual penal code.

[00:36:11]
Yeah, you can tell he hasn't done anything wrong just by his demeanor.

[00:36:16]
I mean, he would be trying to hide things if he were blocking witnesses or evidence or something like that. You'd be like, oh, you're hiding something, but otherwise. Right.

[00:36:25]
And let them let him see everything. Let them prove whatever you want me to prove.

[00:36:31]
Right. But Trump is blocking witnesses. I don't care.

[00:36:40]
Oh, but we were saying earlier that if you're blocking something that shows that you have something to hide, didn't Obama hide his birth certificate?

[00:36:49]
He did. And Trump found that thing and said he was an American citizen. Yeah, I know. So. So who's got egg on their face? Yeah.

[00:36:58]
You know, who has egg on their face. Wow. So what do these supporters see in our impeached presidents future? And they're going to impeach him again.

[00:37:06]
There's going to be another impeachment. I probably all the way to four or five more years. Did you feel the impeachment was a distraction? Not at all. I don't think he's got skin that is about as thick as it gets. Donald Trump has thick skin, thick skin. He gets mad if a celebrity makes fun of him on Twitter. Well, the I like his tweeting.

[00:37:27]
He should take a victory lap. It should have already happened. Yeah. Yeah. What should he do? Alan Dershowitz got O.J. off. O.J. wrote a book. Dershowitz gets Trump off to read the book. I mean, you can do whatever he wants.

[00:37:38]
Let's say it happens tomorrow. Trump beats impeachment. Trump can get on to running the country exactly like he like he has been doing for the past three and a half years now and now would like no impediments, no checks, no balances. Exactly. They need to have like more restrictions on who can just come up with articles for impeachment when nothing's been done. It was it Donald Trump's way going forward. The only people that would be in is where are the Republicans trying to get in office.

[00:38:02]
He's finally he's evolved this presidency into a dictatorship that we could all understand. Exactly.

[00:38:07]
Yeah. Why do these folks care at all about our president declaring himself absolute ruler? I think I might know the answer.

[00:38:19]
I don't care. Exactly. In the era of covid, social gatherings come with a certain amount of risk, but Trump supporters have found safer footing on water.

[00:38:35]
So I chartered a boat and went to New Jersey baby, the site of a Trump rally on boats while the president himself isn't there. He shouted out to his beautiful boaters. And it's the perfect way for me to get back out into the fields to get my sea legs under me. I had to talk to a real deal maker yachtsman like Captain John of Toms River. Save social distancing practices meant staging an interview that was not awkward at all.

[00:39:01]
We're going to the Donald Trump parade today and rally, as we're expect, over a thousand boats. I got to say, I'm getting a little bit of boat envy here. Well, boat envy. Penis envy. You know, I was making that connection, too. Yeah.

[00:39:15]
Enough land talk. I wanted to see just how impressive these beautiful voters were. It is a line of trump boats as far as the eye can see. It really just keeps going. It's like an election polling place in a minority district. How are you voting for. Who are you? Who are you voting for? Must be undecided. I'm usually not so worried out on the water, but technically this is an entire armada of Jersey drivers. I think you do too little history about the area.

[00:39:54]
We're here in the Jersey Shore. That's the cove where Snooki got finger. Over there is the beach that Chris Christie had to himself. We make America Great again is a weird slogan for an incumbent. I'm worried about voters. Absolutely love him. And the president loves boating. But why? Well, because a lot of beautiful women come with the deal, number one. And he's always been he loves women. You know, that was obvious when I first met him.

[00:40:28]
And, you know, as another man, I could tell you could tell he was his way of looking at a woman. And you know what? Another to him, right?

[00:40:35]
Oh, yeah.

[00:40:36]
That's the kind of guy who was in charge and was on his motor yacht down in Atlantic City. He had threw a party on it. And I was I was a guest on board. You were a guest on board. It was great. Don Johnson was there. Robin Leach. I mean, it was really a who's who, you know, now what?

[00:40:51]
Trump Life was allowed to be on the boat. What Trump mistress and future wife was on the wall.

[00:40:56]
I met both of his wives in past years and I read the first one and the second one. I remember the first time I met him is his aura came in the room before he did.

[00:41:05]
If you had to rank Trump's energy from a scale of zero to one hundred and thirty thousand, what would you like it at the top of the, you know, top of the spectrum?

[00:41:14]
Hundred thirty thousand, close to forty thousand. These numbers keep going up.

[00:41:18]
Yeah, I know, but he's that powerful. I mean, he's getting bombarded from all sides and he's just stand there. He's not flinching. Yeah. Yeah, he's it's almost like he's doing nothing. Well, in many ways you're correct.

[00:41:32]
You support the basic tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement. Oh, OK, you're the systemic racism is something that we all together have to collectively work together to dismantle.

[00:41:46]
Well, I don't know if they're understanding let's try something more than speed. What's your favorite Bon Jovi song? I wonder what the relationship is between number of flags and midlife sexual insecurities. One to one, if you can't beat them, join them. So I used Maritime's signal flags to speak the beautiful language of the top tella. As the day wound down, it was clear the event was a success.

[00:42:20]
Of course, the threshold was pretty low for one player and one thing broke. Yeah, or one minority, to be fair. Well, not true. Look closely. You'll see everybody here knows everybody. The front, it's very diverse. I see yachts. I see skiffs. I see jet skis.

[00:42:41]
Sure, the rest of the country is suffering through a historic pandemic and a major economic and racial reckoning. But out here for the bare chested admirals, the jet ski superheroes and the frozen pirates, there's still only one man suited to be president.

[00:42:56]
He doesn't speak or, you know, like a normal politician, but he talks like a billionaire and a businessman out of New York. Yeah, I know a lot of people. I mean, because I'm a businessman, I have lots of friends that are very successful business people. And he you know, he's really perfect for the job right now.

[00:43:13]
Do you think you're speaking from a position of privilege?

[00:43:15]
No, not so much a privilege, but just my instinct. Again, to be clear, your position is on the front of a 50 foot long yacht.

[00:43:24]
Seventy seven. Yeah, but you're a common man. I am.

[00:43:29]
You might think I was in the hot sun, bouncing on choppy seas. Listening to choppy arguments might take its toll on a liberal land lover like myself. And you'd be right. On the day Donald Trump most likely contracted covid at an event in the Rose Garden, he hosted another slightly different kind of super spreader event, a campaign rally. These rallies are known vector for spreading many of Trump's favorite lies. So I traveled to the battleground state of Pennsylvania to see just how many people had called Trump's version of reality.

[00:44:09]
I'm having a Trump rally in Harrisburg, Pa.. We are weeks away from the election, months away from finding out who wins, and probably about a year away from losing a loved one to the inevitable civil war. Let's do this. Make America great again. Rainbow flag classic. A gun. Mind if I check out some of your stuff yesterday we did. Fifty four hundred dollars. So what is selling now? Is there anything? Two hundred thousand deaths later.

[00:44:47]
That doesn't quite work as well. Not with the Trump stuff. It's almost as if the Trump stuff isn't affected by that at all. Exactly. Yeah. Uh, tell me about these shorts. Well, we got the Donald Trump shorts. You know, we got a president for that. You got to be careful with Donald Trump that close to your genitals in a decade. He's going to deny he was ever there. And countersue is pretty funny.

[00:45:06]
When did you get out here to see Donald Trump? About twenty six hours ago, 10:00 yesterday morning. So you're going to wait two days to see the president. First of all, come on. Donald Trump is our first rock star super hero president. He's the real life Tony Stark. They should call him President Iron Man. Well, Tony Stark gave a shit about science. So much excitement in the air, so many droplets. You feel like people are going to feel this effect for weeks to come.

[00:45:36]
Why no mask? Frankly, I forgot it in my car. I forgot to grab it on the way out. I don't think it's not even for covid. I just think all of the Sharpey fumes are so not super healthy. Probably not when it was still wet. What do you think about the whole mask situation right now? Are you worried about covid? For me, like me personally, I'm not worried, but my dad is like underlying health conditions.

[00:46:00]
OK, so if he gets it, he's got to be in trouble. Why come here and take that risk if your dad has health issues just to see Trump? So it's it's worth a little bit of risk. Yeah. Nice black man, I love them, wear a mask, you know, back at it, I don't like the efficacy of Trump's herd mentality.

[00:46:30]
Theory was on full display.

[00:46:32]
That's America right there at freedom. That's freedom. That's freedom. You excited about this? Go? Of course I am. What you excited about? It's going to fill the court with constitutional loving Americans. Again, that court has been too liberal for too long. Really? Of course it you're pro-life. Of course, it's important for Americans to do whatever they can to protect a human life. Yes. Why aren't you wearing a mask? I mean, again, it's a personal choice.

[00:46:56]
I think if everybody was wearing them and everybody said, put a mask on, I respect everybody's wishes and put it on. We're not sheep. You're not cheap. But if everybody here was wearing masks, if everybody was wearing. But again, we're not sheep. You're not. We're not. Are you going to look at what everybody's doing and you're going to. That's it. Yeah, but not people. Not people.

[00:47:16]
As the not sheep were bravely running into a tightly packed airplane hangar to see Patient Zero, I couldn't help but think of D-Day and the beaches of Normandy. I don't know which side they're on. As I trace the spread of bullshit, I was fearful for those most vulnerable whose defenses were already compromised about two months before covid started.

[00:47:37]
I somebody. Put me on the queue and I believe some of it, and I don't believe some of it, but I believe only so much can be a conspiracy. I think a lot of it's true.

[00:47:46]
You know, about Kuhnen, is there anything you can tell us that I don't know, JFK Jr. is still alive.

[00:47:52]
What? This guy is always behind Trump at the rally.

[00:47:54]
So you're saying JFK Jr. is still alive and spending his time in the background, a Trump rally from Cuidad? Yes. Do you think racism exists in America? I do not believe that people hate each other as much as, you know, racism is a problem in America. I do not think it's a problem now. There's a potential that JFK Jr. is alive and here at a Trump rally.

[00:48:12]
It may be hilarious, but with just over a month until the voters go to the polls, had the president somehow already contaminated election, Biden is elected?

[00:48:24]
Uh huh. You trust the results now with our cheater's. But if Trump wins, do you trust the results? Yes, absolutely. I think mail in ballots is not going to be fair because it leads to fraud and stuff. You don't you don't trust mail in ballots at all. The president uses mail in ballots, right? Yeah. They're going to use mail in ballots for this upcoming election. Right. But the president himself uses mail in ballots.

[00:48:48]
Oh, he does where? He does how he votes. He mailed it in. Yes. If I was a diver, I don't I don't know. I honestly know that. Oh, you know what you're talking. But you do know step after hours in the heavily contaminated parking lot.

[00:49:04]
I want wanted to self quarantine and chill, but I still had one burning question.

[00:49:09]
Are you in a better place than you were four years ago? Absolutely. Absolutely. Is America a better place than they were before? I believe absolutely. We have higher unemployment. We have 200000 people dead due to cover and we have riots in the street.

[00:49:20]
Yes. Let me just tell you this much. Yes, I'm doing much better. I'm literally making four times as much as I was making when Obama was president. What do you do? I work for a debt relief company. Yeah. So now as a debt relief employee, you make more money under Donald Trump. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good to be a white debt relief collector. After an historic 227 year campaign, I found myself at another Trump rally, one of three he was having in Pennsylvania that very day.

[00:49:56]
And while there was still some of the usual totally realistic expectations, I'm calling 47 states the Trump at this rally in the final week of election season, I noticed something different.

[00:50:07]
It was quiet, but people just tired.

[00:50:12]
You know, I think people I think people are exhausted. Me, too. And I'm ready to move on.

[00:50:17]
I've been to a lot of Trump rallies before, and I have to say this is probably the most subdued rally I've been to. It's eerily quiet. You can hear a kuhnen push notification, dig in someone's pocket.

[00:50:31]
This was a chance to hear Trump make his final case. And frankly, for Muga country to do the same talk about the economy, he provided jobs.

[00:50:40]
And when people are working and not out looting and burning cities, historically, this presidency has lost more jobs than any other country. That's not true. He hasn't. He has. I feel like I need my heat. I think, in fact, what's on the fact sheet? The fact is that in my car we have not had a fact sheet before. This is really brilliant. I'm bringing it. I hope it doesn't have a list of all the dead, because I think it's going to be huge, OK, jobs added four million under Phaidon and Obama negative two point one.

[00:51:17]
What is the Web site? I don't know. So you don't have to Google it.

[00:51:22]
OK, so her friend didn't have the facts, but she did have the Zinfandel.

[00:51:27]
Let's talk about African-American paintings and all the things we've done for that. Great. What are they done with the. You know, when he was corrected, the you got to help me out here. Can come here while I waited for Tony to get her shit together. I wanted to wrap my head around their Hail Mary October surprise. And that's Hunter Biden and his. Well, I'll just let them explain it.

[00:51:54]
You can see on Fox and one American news about the the laptop, the Biden's laptop and then all the corruption, taking money from the different countries, you know, from Russia and China. And Joe Biden would do whatever these countries needed. What did to do? Well, he would either what he did or did not do. What didn't what did it do? You have to be determined exactly what he did.

[00:52:18]
I saw paedophilia in China, something I do believe in. I don't know. I that's something I have to look into a lot more. We see about like the Hunter Biden scandal. What exactly happened with that? I think they they found a laptop that had, you know, emails and there was the FBI. They found a laptop with like emails and pictures of, you know, Biden talking with like Ukraine and China about business deals and stuff like that, which Biden, Hunter, Biden did.

[00:52:44]
Did something happen? They want to push it to get it, you know, get the investigation under way before the election. But what's the investigation all about? The laptop and on what was on the laptop? I mean, could the conspiracy theorists would say that it's Joe Biden and Hunter Biden communicating with outside countries on business deals and stuff like that? Are you calling him a conspiracy theorist? That's just what he said. Right.

[00:53:06]
The conspiracy, because only because it hasn't been proven to make a ton of money and do absolutely nothing except that, hey, you can meet my dad. That's a disgusting trait, right? To just use your father's name to make money off of that.

[00:53:19]
Absolutely. Nepotism needs to be looked into big time. Yes. What do you think about Ivanka? Oh, she's so gracious. I see Ivanka as someone who is following or creating and enhancing people's lives around jobs and training and whatever causes she has, just like Lady Diana had 20 years ago, she had certain causes, AIDS and different things like that. She was involved with Lady Diana seeking copyrights in China while she had a position of power. I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:53:48]
As the horn rang in, the masses filed into the last rally, there was a bittersweet feeling in the air. Folks are not. And this the last chance for them to get unfettered access to the United States after after this and maybe through Plexiglas, maybe with a telephone, if this somber attitude was a reflection of what could happen on Election Day, are these folks prepared for a world post?

[00:54:12]
Trump Trump can totally win if for some chance he doesn't win. What happens to all of this afterwards? Me personally, I'm sure I will not live under a socialist government and just look up the three red flags on the Biden campaign poster. There's three red lines. Yeah. Look it up on Google. Well, I think it's an E it's supposed to be an E, but look at the three red flags or three red banners and they mean communism.

[00:54:43]
He's not communism right there on the flag. You got it. Really? You don't want to be in a place of socialized medicine. So where would you go? I'm going to look at Costa Rica, Costa Rica, which has universal health care. Yeah. I mean, I'm just I'm not going to live under socialist rule. I don't think Biden's going to make the four years and the CamelBak. Forget it. The CamelBak. Who's at Hamala. Oh, wow.

[00:55:06]
That bug mispronounced the name and xenophobic. Yeah, absolutely. Wow. That's a twofer. If they don't take in Costa Rica, I'm sure Argentina would welcome you and your point of view with open arms.

[00:55:19]
So the pitches have been made and the escape routes planned. Nothing left to do other than vote your asses off and hope we get the results soon. Until then, I'll be hiding out right here. Good luck, America. Trump's people were gathering. So I went to Washington, D.C., to the self-proclaimed and self counted million Muga March, where moms for Trump good dads and free jazz instrumentalists for Trump.

[00:55:50]
Converge to do what exactly we have to celebrate that we. Oh, you're four years too late. You're four years too late. I wanna know if you find this to you, not the size of the flag that matters, it's how many votes you get.

[00:56:14]
The Electoral College system, they were here to celebrate the fact that America is a rich, diverse nation with so many different kinds of alleged election fraud people.

[00:56:24]
There's people that's that's changing votes. Who people across across the United States. Where did you hear this? All over. We can't ignore we're talking about having 10 people vote. No. One, should Trump have appealed more to the dead person vote? Should he appeal? We just need fairness. To me. The biggest fraud is, unfortunately, the millions of voters that voted for Biden that were brainwashed by the media. Everybody on their flag. It's a big flag.

[00:56:58]
Yes. Those are not an American flag. The Stars and Stripes on her brother can appreciate it. You know, it feels like it's mostly Donald Trump obscuring. Appreciate if you don't stand, to be honest, if anybody is disrespecting the flag, I think it's the 10 foot high. Donald Trump. I have an analogy in the NFL, there's a close play. What are they? Do they review it? Right. And sometimes it takes some 15 minutes to leave the game.

[00:57:23]
They're going to look at every little technicality. Let me do one. I got an analogy. It's like the NFL. There's a game, OK? It's the Lions versus the Packers. The Lions lose. Everybody goes home. But the Lions stay on the field and they say we didn't lose. And everybody's like, well, if you look at the scoreboard, it's like, oh, you can lose from what?

[00:57:41]
He had less votes. Oh, yeah, yeah. But you got to take California out of the equation and he wins the national. If you definitely discount certain people, then the numbers add up in your favor. OK, what one in Flagstaff is stole it going blatantly. What's what's the evidence. The mail in ballots. First of all, we all know the whole corona was to send the mail in ballots. How to steal the election along with the voting machines are all compromised.

[00:58:11]
So anyway, the corona was created to create damage. The Democrats are working with the communist Chinese to put Biden in because because China has blackmail on Joe Biden. That is a fact that on any true love, no people are stealing our elections. This is our country. People are stealing our life. How are they stealing the election? Because they're putting voter fraud suspicious. How are they putting voter fraud? Department of Homeland Security Services, the most secure election Americans lose out.

[00:58:39]
That's one guy like you and me, Bruce, if that's done, OK, I like you, Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security. And so because one person says something that's good, that's what it is. It's the government and the court. Trump's lawyer said there's no fraud. Don't try and twist the big politics for a long time. Don't try to ask me that. You're in politics. I am the regional Tea Party chairman. You're the Tea Party.

[00:59:01]
I'm the Tea Party member of the original Tea Party chairman at the breakfast. Read you. Come on. Thank you. What? You got yourself a safe space. We are patient. Let me get this straight. You're yelling at me to find a safe space and you have elevated yourself with a megaphone and you have a shield.

[00:59:15]
They were having trouble facing the reality at hand, though. There were occasional signs of progress, something fitting about a U-Haul truck here.

[00:59:22]
Yet no one seems to acknowledge that Trump's legal defense is crumbling.

[00:59:26]
It doesn't matter, though, for these guys. Some battles never end.

[00:59:30]
What does is that Trump that's Trump on a Confederate flag. That's Confederate flag. Yeah, that's still left. Come on. But you don't know how to pick a winner. You might as well put a Jets hat on.

[00:59:45]
And they don't trust this election's narrative, which the rest of the world is seen. What do they trust? I trust Trump and what he says, what he knows. You know, I don't trust the media that much. So the only person you really believe is Donald Trump himself. That's not the only person. Who else do you believe? I mean, ultimately, I believe Jesus is king and I believe the Bible like to Jesus and Trump. Now, I trust a lot of people, my friends, my family.

[01:00:10]
Are you saying Tucker Carlson, Tucker Carlson, Jesus and Donald Trump and more. I could go on and on. No, I think I get the picture. We used to like Fox. We don't like Fox. We don't like MSNBC. We don't like CBS. We don't like any of the fake news channels because they lie all the time. What happened to Fox? Was it their covid coverage that turned, you know, what about had it?

[01:00:30]
I like Hannity, Tucker, Tucker and Tucker.

[01:00:32]
So just two hours everyday of Fox News. Otherwise it's a complete boycott. Yes, absolutely. Even Fox wasn't welcome at this mug a palooza, which was feeling less like the peace and love of Woodstock and more like the buzz kill at Altamont. Get are signaling the end of an era complete with actual knife violence. The liberal media. I have one word for you. You are controlled by the deep state. That's like four, five or six words.

[01:01:01]
Ten words. That's even two. That one's even to make news. I have no idea how the silent majority works. That's that's two words alone and no one in the muggle world. Kont.
