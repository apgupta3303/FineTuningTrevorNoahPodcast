You're listening to Comedy Central. OK, now listen, this has AJ and his Timboon, and we're giving great, bad advice. Never give a bad, great advice on our new show. We Talk Back. Yeah, we're talking about a whole lot of sex. I love the sex and a bunch of money. We love the money and relationships we don't work on. And it feels like. Yes. And listen to we talk back every Thursday on the radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your back is.

[00:00:40]
Yo, what's going on, everybody? Welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show. I'm Trevor Noah and I'm happy to report that I've just completed my first New Year's resolution, which was that I would learn a brand new instrument, actually wrote a little song for you guys. It's called Twenty Twenty into twenty twenty one.

[00:01:08]
Anyway, on tonight's show, we pay tribute to Malani as many accomplishments as first lady. The NBA is taking on coronavirus and everyone has already forgotten about what's his name, the guy with the hair. Plus, Jelani Cobb is on the show to talk about what's next for the country. So let's do this, people. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:01:32]
From Trevor's coach in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world, this is The Daily Show with criminal lawyers.

[00:01:43]
Let's kick things off with a story that just won't end the coronavirus pandemic, because I know America has begun a new era, but Corona doesn't care about who's president. In fact, it's been exactly one year since we first learned that covid-19 had reached the United States and things have only gotten worse. Yesterday, the country set a new record for coronavirus deaths, and the CDC now predicts that half a million deaths will happen by mid-February, which is going to make for a weird Valentine's Day.

[00:02:16]
And Valentine's Day is already pretty weird, I suppose, by an adult woman, a teddy bear as creepy as hell. The point is, it's more important than ever to step up on covid safety, which is exactly what the NBA's doing.

[00:02:28]
Well, after witnessing some opposing players disregarding new league rules against unnecessary contact on game nights. The NBA is now moving team security to midcourt following games to stop the hugging and handshakes that may cause an unwanted spread of covid-19. High fives, hugs and handshakes, along with extended postgame conversations are no longer allowed.

[00:02:49]
Man, this is so hosch guys. covid won't even let you shake hands with opponents. Now, that's a hard habit to break because we've been doing that since we were five years old. You know, you play a game when you line up and you high five, the other team saying good game. Next, they're going to say that what, covid won't let you eat three slices at half time or drive past the ice cream store because your dad says only one does deserve ice cream.

[00:03:10]
But look, I get it. You've got to do what you've got to do to stop covid, and who knows, this could even create some excitement after the game.

[00:03:18]
And here it is, Harden going up for a high five. And this is it. Oh, no. He's rejected. He's rejected by a security guard named Stanley at the same time, though.

[00:03:30]
Well, let's really make a difference. I mean, I'm all for covid safety, but these guys have been sweating and breathing on each other for two hours already and then they can't shake hands. It's like handing out condoms as people are leaving your orgy. Remember to be safe. Remember, that was fun, guys. Remember, Dave, remember, there was no I mean, I'm not going to like this just shows how covid has turned the whole world upside down.

[00:03:55]
Players are now getting into trouble for being nice to each other, like, yeah, you better hold me back.

[00:04:01]
I'm about to hug. Just yeah. I respect you. So I will hug you right now. Whoo hoo hoo. Anyway, between the pandemic and all the insanity around the presidential election, they have been all sorts of stories that we just haven't had time to talk about. But they've kind of gotten stuck in my brain. And I thought, well, maybe I could unstick them by sharing them with you.

[00:04:23]
For instance, here's some big news you might have missed out of Russia, a.k.a. Mean Canada, Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic, Alexei Navalny, who was nearly poisoned to death, returning to Russia and immediately detained a dangerous gamble for one of Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics.

[00:04:41]
And he was arrested minutes after arriving in Moscow, kissing his wife goodbye. Alexei Navalny has now been detained for at least 30 days, prompting outrage around the world. Navalny nearly died last year after being poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon novikoff. He fell ill on an airplane, blaming the Kremlin for the attack, something they deny. OK, I don't know what's crazy out here, that this dude went back to the same country that tried to kill him or that they arrested him when he got there.

[00:05:14]
Apparently in Russia, it's a felony to not die when they poison you. Why did you do that? You make to look like you don't know poison. Well, you do that. The Putin look, even Navalny is the bravest dude alive or he's just really grown to love the taste of poison. I mean, I don't know, maybe poison is delicious. It's just that no one ever survives to tell us maybe the most delicious thing in the world.

[00:05:33]
We don't know. Actually, I want to try poison, though. But either way, this guy has bigger balls than me. I'm not going to lie because I would not be going back to Russia right now. If we get the poisoning, it's the middle of winter or Putin has to do delay, right, for five minutes and you're done.

[00:05:50]
Meanwhile, in tech news, here's a story I really can't stop thinking about involving Bitcoin, the money that lives in space over the last few months, the value of the virtual currency has skyrocketed to insane heights, which is great for people who own it. But it'll never catch up to the market value of my Pok√©mon cards. That's right, people. I've been saving up these bad mom.

[00:06:18]
What do you do about Pokemon anyway?

[00:06:22]
One of the big draws of Bitcoin is how secure it is.

[00:06:25]
Unfortunately for one investor, it's turning out to be a little too secure a virtual nightmare for a man with a quarter billion dollars in Bitcoin.

[00:06:34]
Yes, billion. He's forgotten his password. Stefan Thomas says he's been locked out of his account since twenty twelve. Back then, it wasn't as much of a forger because each of his seven thousand coins was worth about ten bucks in cash. Now, going the going rate, you know how much it is. It's thirty seven grand. What? The man has the password stored on an old hard drive, but he lost the password to that too. And there's only two more tries before he gets locked out.

[00:07:03]
Wow, what a feel good story in that I feel good that it's not me. This guy can't access a quarter billion dollars because he can't remember his password. Let me tell you something. For a quarter of a billion dollars, I'm hiring people to beat the shit out of me until I do remember. Don't go. Yeah, come on, guys. I know from talking to five case. Yes, yes, I remember. And finally from Colombia, an exciting setup for a brand new season of Narcos.

[00:07:40]
A notorious drug lords exotic pets are now posing an environmental disaster. Pablo Escobar is four hippos escaped after he was killed and are now taking over the marshlands in Colombia. Experts say they are breeding so fast there, there could be more than fifteen hundred in the next couple of years posing a danger to the people and wildlife.

[00:08:02]
They are now saying the so-called cocaine hippos should be shot because, yeah, you go shoot the cocaine hippos who were raised by Pablo Escobar. I'm just going to stay out of the water. And I know some people are going to be like, do you have to shoot those hippos? Why not just round them up and put them in a zoo?

[00:08:22]
No. We're not going to be taking Pablo Escobar as hippos and putting them in a zoo because, you know, three weeks later they're going to escape through a tunnel that they built out from under the cage. Is going to be a note left behind from the hippo saying no zookeeper alive can hold me.

[00:08:40]
Yeah, you see, some people would think that the Colombian hippos are going to sound Colombian, but hippos from Africa. So I like to keep the jokes authentic. I've got to say, though, man over reproduction is the most badass reason to be exterminated. When was the last time you had so much sex that the government had to step in? The good news is there is an easier solution to this problem. Just release some meth. GAYDOS to deal with the cocaine hippo's then to deal with the meth gaiters.

[00:09:07]
You release the Molly Cobras, then to take out the Molly Cobras, you release the straight edge Tagore's. They don't do cocaine because the real thrill is being in control. Here's a question I have, though. I've always wondered this. What's the deal with drug dealers and animals? It's like the higher you go up the ladder, the crazier your pet has to be. The dealer on the corner has a fish tank. The drug lord has hippo's.

[00:09:30]
I bet that family that invented Oxy has a T rex just chained up in the backyard. Why you can't you can have gotten more than just the fine, but let's move on now to the big story of the day, the inauguration of Joseph Robin Hood.

[00:09:46]
Biden yesterday after being sworn in on the book that knows when we're all going to die. Biden became the 40 sixth president of the United States, but he couldn't run the whole country himself. So immediately after being sworn in, he turned around and administered the oath of office to his new White House staff. And hopefully all four thousand people on the room were paying attention for new members of the Biden administration.

[00:10:09]
A virtual swearing in. And we have to restore the soul of this country. And I'm counting on all of you to be part of that.

[00:10:16]
And a stern warning for the new commander in chief. If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot. On the spot. No ifs, ands or buts.

[00:10:33]
OK, wow. That took a turn. Welcome to a new era of kindness and respect. And if you're not on board with that, I'll rip your nipples off. But insisting on respect is just one of the ways that President Biden is trying to make a clean break from his predecessor. In fact, he even redecorated his office to be as un trumpy as possible.

[00:10:53]
We're getting new details right now about the inside of President Biden's Oval Office. A bust of Cesar Chavez, for example, sitting behind the resolute desk along with statues of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.

[00:11:07]
It is Joe Biden's stamp on the Oval Office, but some of it is familiar. If you see those gold drapes, you see the blue carpet on the floor. Those are in the Oval Office during the Bill Clinton presidency because the decor is certainly different than it was under President Trump.

[00:11:19]
OK. First question, is it really an improvement to switch out Trump's carpet for Bill Clinton's I mean, on Trump's carpet? Yes, you can catch covid, but on Clintons, you could get pregnant. And look, I respect history, but at some point it starts getting suspicious. This desk was used by President Roosevelt. Whoa. And these chairs were set on by President Kennedy and these drapes were hung by President Monroe.

[00:11:48]
Are you broke? Is that what's going on here? But I do think it's cool that no matter what other changes the president makes, the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. stays behind because no one wants to be the guy who removes the bust of MLK once it enters the room. It's never good. If a tornado hit the Oval Office, it would still go around MLK.

[00:12:11]
I'm not racist. I'm not racist. Now, of course, redecorating the Oval Office is just a symbolic change, but even after one day, people are already noticing how different Biden's presidency will be from Donald Trump's.

[00:12:27]
You just got President Biden's schedule for tomorrow, his first full day in office as as president. I imagine it's a little bit busier than what we've been reading.

[00:12:38]
This the former president's schedule, and this is a return to normalcy, also return to functioning government. The White House press office is now actually sending out press releases that are informative. So instead of having the Trump administration say Trump is making many calls, the Biden team is actually revealing the calls. That's a good sign. That's progress.

[00:12:55]
President Biden is now unveiling a national strategy to tackle covid.

[00:13:00]
First of all, I just have to say that it's great that we have somebody that comes out and actually has a plan today, felt like a new day.

[00:13:09]
I mean, the press briefing was boring as hell, and that was refreshing how we didn't have to count how many lives Jen Psaki was telling. We didn't have to get up there and hear her talking about the largest crowd size of yelling at the media.

[00:13:21]
Yo, guys, Joe Biden is so lucky. All he has to do is have a vaccine plan and not live for ten minutes. And he's basically, what, the next George Washington. And we all know this is only thanks to Donald Trump for setting the bar so low.

[00:13:37]
It's like getting hired as a babysitter. And your predecessor was a Roomba covered in knives. You got to be better and less useful. Life lesson here for all of us. Always follow the worst possible person. Like if you want to date someone, wait until after they've broken up with Armie Hammer. Baby, I promise I will never eat your flesh. What a gentleman. In fact, people are so excited to be moving on from Trump that some at Biden's inauguration celebration were already pretending that Trump never existed at all.

[00:14:11]
The appearances by three former presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, but not President Trump.

[00:14:18]
Well, I think the fact that the three of us are standing here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country. We've got to not just listen to folks we agree with, but listen to folks we don't. You think about the three presidents, the three former presidents that we saw gathered together to speak about this moment in history, to speak about the new president.

[00:14:42]
The former president who just left office could have been among those three, could have been four and forever more. Now one considers when there are gatherings of all the presidents, will the most recent president who just left? Will he be in there? All right.

[00:15:01]
Is it just me or was Anderson Cooper working overtime to avoid saying the word Trump? Dude, you can't summon him by saying his name, but as an ex-president, not Beetlejuice. Just say Trump. But I will say this. I'm not surprised. And nobody should be surprised that Trump doesn't want to be a part of the former president's club. It's kind of like when Don Felder left the Eagles because he was jealous of Glenn Frey and Don Henley success.

[00:15:27]
OK, I'm going to be honest, guys. I don't actually know what anything in that joke means. I'm just trying to win over some of these white people who don't have a leader anymore. So, yeah, honestly speaking, I think Trump not being included in this club is for the best because one of these guys is going to talk about, you know, everybody can agree being a president is one of the hardest jobs in the world. Am I right?

[00:15:47]
Tell me about it, dude. Sometimes I would have to work 12 hours a month. It was excruciating. And while I understand that people want to pretend Trump didn't exist, the truth is he did. Not only did he exist, but his presidency was historic. Like, you may not realize that because we're living in it because he sent a mob to ransack the capital. People are going to be talking about this forever. We're living in a history book right now in like 100 years.

[00:16:19]
They're going to be doing musicals about this Trump era. We're going to march on the capital, not me. I'm going home, but you guys going to go in all alone and I'm going to be a monk.

[00:16:29]
I will say, though, it really was moving to see those former presidents together, two Democrats, one Republican paying tribute to the new kid, although there was one moment in there that I, I really wasn't expecting.

[00:16:41]
I think inaugurations signal a tradition of a peaceful transfer of power that is over two centuries old. So this is an unusual thing. We are both trying to come back to normalcy, interrupt you guys.

[00:16:57]
But just in the khakis line around here, it's got a whole keychain. Well, I think the fact that the three of us are standing here talking about a peaceful transfer of the controls, but the key chain is of keeping on red mustache.

[00:17:15]
But make it no dick. Very everybody could just check that general area. Appreciate it. I'll be right out your hair.

[00:17:21]
We've got to not just listen to folks. We agree with you, but listen to folks we don't. America's a generous country. People with great hearts. All three of us look out for our country.

[00:17:33]
Check your pockets, Roy. All right. When we come back, we say goodbye to one of President Trump's most vicious critics, his wife. And Jelani Cobb is still joining us on the show. So stick around. What's up, guys?

[00:17:47]
I'm Rasha below, and I am Troy Millions. And we are the host of the Ernie Ilija podcast, where we break down business models and examine the latest trends and findings.

[00:18:15]
What do explorers and army officer and a Minnesota insurance salesman have in common, they all wanted to be the first to reach the North Pole, but only one of them made it on Katlehong. Science editor at Mental Floss and host of the new podcast, The Quest for the North Pole, which dives into the centuries long race to explore the Arctic, find the Northwest Passage and conquer the top of the world with a cast of daring adventurers and some pretty determined amateurs, the race to the poll reveals the human desire to solve mysteries of geography and the soul.

[00:18:46]
We'll look at the important Arctic expeditions that filled the blank spaces on the map and recognize how indigenous people made them successful. We'll examine what pushed explorers to venture ever farther into the unknown and uncharted and how the climate crisis is changing the Arctic today. Listen to the quest for the North Pole every Friday on the radio app, Apple podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show, despite what the liberal media tells you, a lot of people were upset that the Trump presidency ended yesterday.

[00:19:25]
There was Trump himself, the Trump kids.

[00:19:31]
Coronavirus, probably others, but one person who surprisingly seemed happy about the end of President Trump was his wife, Melania. And why shouldn't she be?

[00:19:41]
She got a lot done in her time as first lady. And so tonight we say farewell to Melania as we look back at all her achievements.

[00:19:52]
The first lady of the United States, she's the partner of the president, hostess of the White House and back up Snuffleupagus, but while hashtag all lives matter, there's one first lady who matters more than any other. Melania Trump. Fashion icon, animal lover, colonial explorer, on January 20th, 2017, this third wife became America's first lady.

[00:20:28]
It was a moment she celebrated with great joy and instant regret. And while public life can put a strain on a relationship, it only made Melania and Donald stronger.

[00:20:42]
Since day one, they've been inseparable. If you don't count the six months she stayed in New York while she reportedly renegotiated her prenup.

[00:20:49]
But after that, it was a love story for the ages, those ages being a hot 50 and, I don't know, 97.

[00:20:58]
During their time in the White House, Melania Donald were often seen taking long romantic walks, holding hands, trying to hold hands and refusing to hold hands. Yes, you could always see the look of fiery passion whenever Melania was at her husband's side. And it's easy to see why the first lady's husband live to spoil her.

[00:21:19]
It's Melania's birthday. So happy birthday to Melania. Do you want to tell us what you got her?

[00:21:25]
Well, I better not get into that because I may get in trouble. Maybe I didn't get her so much.

[00:21:29]
There's nothing more romantic than a man of mystery.

[00:21:33]
But a first lady's job is more than just being a devoted wife. She's also in charge of turning the White House into a white home. And Melania let nothing stand in her way. Melania Trump is defending a tweet she sent out about construction on the White House tennis pavilion, which some have criticized as tone deaf amid the coronavirus outbreak.

[00:21:54]
Yes, even in the midst of a global pandemic and with less than six and a half weeks left in office, Melania had the courage to do something literally no one was asking her to do personally.

[00:22:06]
Renovate the White House tennis court, the four inch heels with the golden shovel. And while this renovation was so masterful, it made the property brothers look like the Trump brothers. Amazingly, it came just months after her previous masterpiece, the new White House Rose Garden.

[00:22:22]
The intensely private first lady is facing the glare of the spotlight yet again, criticized for her recent renovation of Jackie Kennedy famous Rose Garden in the Rose Garden, that she put some pretty dramatic changes to good for Melania, who needs roses when a virus is destroying everyone's sense of smell anyway.

[00:22:39]
Besides, if there's one thing a supermodel knows about the importance of removing unpleasant shrubbery and at no point was Melania's flair for design more apparent than during the holiday season, when every Christmas she chose a fun holiday.

[00:22:53]
Things like Ho Ho Ho movie and The Grinch Who Murdered Christmas, although never losing the spirit of the season.

[00:23:02]
Some about Christmas.

[00:23:04]
Yes, thanks to Melania, America's saying Who gives a fuck about Christmas again?

[00:23:11]
But perhaps Melania's greatest legacy as First Lady was her celebration of all God's children whose parents could prove they were citizens.

[00:23:20]
This is a picture of Melania Trump boarding Air Force One to head down in McAllen, Texas, to visit some of the children being held in detention center. She's wearing a green jacket on the back. It's written in white. I really don't care. Do you? Wow.

[00:23:33]
Only Melania could pull off a sleeveless dress and a heartless jacket. But other than that, Melania overflows with love for children.

[00:23:41]
You see, she's not just the stepmom of these four little boss babies.

[00:23:45]
She's the nation's step mom there for America every other weekend and on holidays. So when she saw the bullying epidemic that was tormenting the country, she stepped forward with a grammatically courageous initiative. Today, I'm very excited to announce Be Best, an awareness campaign dedicated to the most valuable and fragile among us, our children.

[00:24:12]
Melania told children across America to be best and be best. They beed. Just look how much this bully learns.

[00:24:20]
Bernie Sanders Crazy Bernie, greatest loser on Earth, Crazy Bernie, one of the greatest losers of all time. This guy. No, but I meant that in a nice way.

[00:24:31]
So thank you, Melania. You made America smile and we hope we made you smile. Now, there it is. Wait. False alarm. There we go. OK, whatever.

[00:24:49]
All right, don't go away, because when we come back, New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb tells me when we can expect Donald Trump to return.

[00:24:56]
Go with. Oh, do you ever wish you could get more from your podcast?

[00:25:04]

[00:25:24]
Listen to BuzzFeed Daily. I mean, I heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. My guests tonight is Jelani Cobb, an award winning journalist and staff writer at The New Yorker. We talked about the last four years and what it's taught us and where Trump goes from here. Jelani Cobb, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:25:51]
Thank you. It's good to see you. It is an interesting time to have you on the show because you are easily one of my favorite just thinkers. You know, there are people who who write and are people who think before they write. And I consider you one of those people I really appreciated, because whether it's talking about policing or police reform, whether it's talking about politics, we're talking about issues of race in America, I always find that you you tackle these ideas from a really interesting place.

[00:26:15]
And so as America begins this new journey under a new president in a new year, my first question to you would be, what do you think about America's future as it stands right now?

[00:26:28]
I think that one of the things that came out of twenty 2020, if you can point to a small number of really good things that did come out of that year was the fact that we had to think about our history because it was reoccurring right in front of us. So much of it, you know, people trying to overrun the capital that called back to certainly black people and people familiar with the history of race in this country. What happened after Reconstruction and Wilmington in 1898 with white supremacist mobs deposed the government because it was interracial and all those historical things that were kind of piled up like kindling, and then they just, you know, burst into flames.

[00:27:15]
We had to deal with it in twenty twenty. And so I think that looking forward, I'm hopeful, but I'm cautiously hopeful that we can actually start thinking about some of the problems that we have and some of the mistakes that we made previously and finding a way to navigate forward.

[00:27:35]
Do you think that there really is a way to to escape some of the mistakes that have been made in the past? And I only ask that because I struggle with America's system being a two party system, I feel like it's inevitable that you get another Trump. And the only reason I feel like it's inevitable is because if you have one or two choices, I feel like statistically it's more likely that people it's going to end up 50 50, which means one side may win again.

[00:27:57]
I don't think everyone who votes Republican likes Trump, but they may like a lot of the policies that are in the party. But then that enables another Trump to come up. What do you think America can actually learn if it maintains a two party system going forward?

[00:28:10]
Yeah, I mean, here's the interesting thing about this conversation, which is that the founders of this country never wanted parties at all. They thought the parties were going to be destructive. That would be the quickest way that the republic would end. And the two party system that we have has collapsed before its collapsed twice in American history. And, you know, some of those dynamics were present then. And so one of the things we think we have to bear in mind in order to the best hope for avoiding that kind of situation is the reminder of how fragile democracy is and also the fact that you kind of win big or go home.

[00:28:51]
Republicans took a really big bet on Donald Trump in 2016. And the lesson they could take is that a demagogic figure like him could succeed, could be elected within particular constraints against a specific kind of opponent. Or they could take the fact that they lost the Senate, they lost the House, they lost the White House. They lost international regard. Virtually all of America's allies. We've seen four hundred thousand and counting people die because of the mismanagement of a pandemic and all those things that could be warnings.

[00:29:29]
And you're right, though, we have a disturbingly high possibility that we could find ourselves in this position again.

[00:29:36]
I remember just before Donald Trump's ascendancy, the Republican Party was having a conversation in and around. We have to expand our tent. Do you think the Republican Party will gravitate towards a world of once again trying to actually appeal to more diverse voters? Or do you think that they've now seen that there was enough excitement and anguish and grievances to maintain a vote and carry on the way they've been going for the last four years?

[00:30:03]
That's the big question. And the best I can tell you is that they have been confronted by this before in nineteen sixty six, which was two years after the 64 election where Barry Goldwater was just destroyed. He lost by four hundred and thirty something Electoral College votes. Just you know, it wasn't if it was a boxing match, they would have stopped it in the third way. And so one of the report then that came out in nineteen sixty six.

[00:30:32]
That said, we have to. Expand, we have to bring different kinds of people into the party. You can't go down the road of just appealing to basically angry white people who at that point were angry about the civil rights movement. But the other part of it is that they are really getting an increasing share of a decreasing population. About 80 percent of their voters are white and white people. Every single election since nineteen ninety six have been a smaller share of the electorate.

[00:31:01]
And so the math is not on their side. And so one of the things that political scientists think is that they may make themselves into, no pun intended, a minority party in the.

[00:31:13]
You've always had your finger on the pulse of law enforcement, for instance, not just criticizing police, but rather saying, hey, here's a system that's broken. Here's how it needs to be fixed and here's why it needs to be fixed. Is there a path to a world where law enforcement becomes equitable, a world where law enforcement no longer maintains its ties to what it was meant to be from the past?

[00:31:32]
Sure. I mean, I think that that's possible, that the things that we've seen, two things in particular, George Floyd and that excruciating eight minute forty six second video that we saw last Memorial Day and the storming of the Capitol grounds and how many off duty police officers were involved in that. And for people who are just kind of. Thinking in the knee jerk fashion or kind of accepting the slogans that the police are the thin blue line that divides us from anarchy and so on.

[00:32:07]
That's shocking for anyone who's actually looked at the data around policing in the United States. It really is not the first people who ever talk to me about defunding the police. And they didn't use that language, but they expressed that idea. The first people who ever talk to me about that were cops themselves saying that they do too many things, but in all kinds of actions, that they're fundamentally not trained to handle mental health crises, which is it makes perfect sense if someone's having a mental health crisis, you call the police, right?

[00:32:39]
I wouldn't call the cops somebody who had a heart attack. A heart attack is not illegal. So they show up in situations, go downhill predictably. And when you're really talking about creating different kinds of structures and infrastructures and cities so that no one one is not the only thing that you call for every single problem of every shape, size or orientation. And so if we have a more broadly based system of how we manage our communities, that goes a long way to reducing the footprint of policing.

[00:33:19]
And in nineteen sixty eight in the County Commission report came out, they said and this is nineteen sixty eight, they said that we should think about creating different kinds of ways of providing services to communities besides just police, especially communities of color is not new. We know, we know some of this stuff.

[00:33:40]
As somebody who writes about the present and looks at it through the lens of history, what do you make of the future now? Are you hopeful about where America has gotten to now on this day, or are you trepidations in considering where America still needs to get you?

[00:33:54]
I'm hopeful, but as I describe it, I have the optimism of a box of going into the late rounds.

[00:34:03]
And what I mean by that is if you haven't been knocked out yet, if you're still upright, the thing that kept you throwing punches and staying in the fight for this long is the thing that will bring you all the way to the finish line. And so is James Baldwin said I have to be an optimist because I'm alive. That said, I don't think you should underestimate the scale of the problems that we're confronting. But dynamics that produced Trump are still very active in the society.

[00:34:32]
The anxiety around immigration, the anxiety around race, the ways in which those compound the economy that truthfully does not serve many people struggling just to get by from day to day. And the way that that has been weaponized and used to fuel xenophobia and racism and so on. Those are very real dynamics and very real problems. And they will not be easily defeated. But I don't think that they are permanent. And I don't think we have to always presume that we can't somehow close off so well.

[00:35:07]
It's going to be an exciting 12th round. Hopefully we get to chatting again afterwards and we haven't been knocked out. Jelani Cobb, thank you so much for joining me on the show.

[00:35:16]
Thank you. All right. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this. I'm Alec Baldwin. Listen to my podcast, here's the thing I heart radio, it's my chance to talk with artists, policy makers and performers like the actress Kristen Bell.

[00:35:34]
And the moment I said, you know what, I have a thing. And it's a quirky, weird, fun thing that can be snarky and I love doing it. I do it pretty well. Why not lean into it? And that is when I felt like I started becoming happier.

[00:35:47]
Music legend Mick Fleetwood Fleetwood Mac was always about change so that you were accepted for who you were.

[00:35:54]
Former governor of Vermont Howard Dean. I took the call in his quavering voice, and the other end of the phone says, I regret to inform you that the governor has died of a heart attack and you're the governor.

[00:36:04]
That was the end of my medical practice and best selling author Isabel Wilkerson.

[00:36:08]
People come up to me of all different backgrounds. I would say to me, I had no idea that this happened in our country.

[00:36:13]

[00:36:27]
I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and it could happen here, and boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.

[00:37:10]
The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. Well, that's our show for tonight, but before we go, as you know, the coronavirus pandemic is as bad as it has ever been, but luckily our first responders are still out on the front lines, saving lives.
