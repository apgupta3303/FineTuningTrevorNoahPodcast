[00:00:10]
No, believe it or not, these are all actual jobs from the past and the stories behind them are fascinating. I'm that beat. And I'm Helen Hong. And every week we take a look at a different occupation that is now jobs elite on our new podcast called, you guessed it, Jobs Elite.

[00:00:35]
In the time that I've been here, I've been following the presidential race and I've noticed that a few pieces of conventional wisdom have formed around the candidates, none more than with Donald Trump.

[00:00:45]
Six in 10 Americans believe Trump is unqualified to serve as president, is not qualified to be president, unfit to be president, unfit to be commander in chief.

[00:00:54]
The Des Moines Register writing that Trump is, quote, not only unfit to hold office, but unfit to stand on the same stage as his Republican opponents.

[00:01:03]
He's unfit for that stage.

[00:01:05]
No, that stage is unfit for Trump. And there's no marble. There's no gold where the woman in bikinis and how would even get there?

[00:01:13]
There's no escalator. Come on, people. So the complaints about Trump is that he's unpresidential and it stems from certain statements that he's made when Mexico sends its people, they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists.

[00:01:30]
And some, I assume, are good people.

[00:01:34]
And you know what they say when you assume you're the best. But assuming Trump.

[00:01:42]
I know these comments about immigrants were upsetting to some people, but for me as an African, there's just something familiar about Trump that makes me feel at home.

[00:01:50]
The influx of illegal migrants climb unfair business practices, drugs.

[00:01:58]
It is also not true that all foreign nationals are involved in criminal activities. There are some who are, but not all of them. I love how we all waited, like, oh, he's not that South African President Jacob Zuma sounding a lot like Donald Trump. You see, that's like xenophobia with just a dash of diplomacy, which is also the title of Paula Dean's new book. So I don't see what's unpresidential about Donald Trump. I mean, here's has another thing he unnecessarily took heat for.

[00:02:40]
Autism has become an epidemic. The beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick. Now is autistic now.

[00:02:52]
Was that factual? No. But was it presidential, depends where you come from. Gambian President Yanmei says he can cure AIDS using herbs and bananas. He admits there will always be skeptics, but he says, quote, Mine is not an argument. Mine is a proof. It's a declaration. I can cure AIDS and I will.

[00:03:13]
That's right. That is right. The president of Gambia says he can cure AIDS with bananas and I can also cure cancer using AIDS, if only I had and cured all that AIDS are crazy things.

[00:03:32]
Better safe than sorry. What I'm trying to say is Donald Trump is presidential. He just happens to be running on the wrong continent in face.

[00:03:40]
In fact, once you once you realize that Trump is basically the perfect African president, you start to notice the similarities everywhere, like the level of self-regard.

[00:03:50]
I say not in a braggadocios way. I've made billions and billions of dollars.

[00:03:56]
I made a tremendous amount of money. I'm really rich. I have a great temperament. They love me anyway. I don't have to do this. I've done an amazing job.

[00:04:03]
I was born with a certain intellect. God helped me by giving me a certain brain.

[00:04:09]
I bet that's the one time that God's like, I don't need the praise. It's cool. That's you. That's you. I'm cool.

[00:04:16]
Now, is that extraordinary level of bragging presidential? Well, let's ask a man who actually was president, Idi Amin, former president and best president of Uganda.

[00:04:25]
The people love me very much. I'm very popular, them, very powerful. I am the one who has got the money. I have got a bit of good brain.

[00:04:42]
I have a very good brain and I know this because every time I ask people if I have a good brain, they say, of course, Mr. President, now please let my family go. You've already killed my sister. I think you've proved your point.

[00:04:56]
And just to make sure everyone knew exactly how successful he was, Idi Amin insisted on always being referred to by his full title. And this is completely true. His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Alhaji, Dr. Idi Amin, Dada VCDs. So M.C., Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conker of the British Empire in Africa in general and Uganda in particular.

[00:05:24]
Luckily, Idi Amin didn't own any casinos. In Trump is so African presidential, he's already at the level of Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, whose brutality and repressive tactics have kept him in power for thirty five years.

[00:05:40]
My people have great praise for me. People love me. Everybody loves me, the little man. He's very low energy plan.

[00:05:46]
He's ours. He's not European. It's our land. And we have taken it will take our country back.

[00:05:54]
We will we we will be with me all the time. We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning. I feel like I'm winning right now. It's really great to know that if anything ever happens to Trump, we have a backup coffee in Africa. I like that, actually.

[00:06:15]
Now that I think about it, Trump reminds me of one African leader in particular. We had here check lavish lifestyle, check fringe discredited views about President Obama's origins.

[00:06:28]
McGlothin us with us.

[00:06:31]
And along came a black citizen of Kenyan African origin, a Muslim. His name is Obama.

[00:06:39]
Check. Oh, and there's one more thing, Gadhafi put up a tent in the town of Bedford, about 40 miles outside of New York City. The property in Westchester County where they're setting up that tent, is owned by none other than Donald Trump.

[00:06:55]
Yeah, that's right, when Moammar Gadhafi came to America, he could have stayed anywhere, but the only place he felt truly at home was in Donald Trump's yard.

[00:07:05]
Now, just by the way, our lawyers told us we have to mention that Trump told Gaddafi to take the tent down. And you see, you have to be careful what you say about Donald Trump in public, not unlike an African president's.

[00:07:19]
I understand that Trump is a little scary. A little exotic for some a little out of America's comfort zone, but this great country is capable of bold leaps. It took one in 2008 when it elected its first black president, now in twenty sixteen. I say it's time to be bold once more and elect America's first African presidents.

[00:07:43]
And when that happens, when a true African finally enters the Oval Office, the people of Africa will erupt into songs of praise, cower in the darkness, who will win when it never ends? They've got to see this Ballandean Mexican rapists.

[00:08:02]
