Well, hello, everybody. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show. I'm Trevor Noah. Today is Wednesday, the 2nd of December, which means there's only forty nine days left until Trump is no longer president and starts selling national secrets on his only friends account anyway. Coming up on tonight's show, the Queen has the vaccine Why Black People Can't Buy Homes. And Michael J. Fox will be joining us on the show. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:02]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with no use of. Let's kick things off with the coronavirus pandemic. You know, the reason why I would not rules on virgins anymore. Today, the world hit a major milestone as Great Britain became the first country to officially approve a fully tested vaccine. So big. Congratulations, Britain. It's amazing how much you can get done when you don't waste time combing your hair.

[00:01:39]
And, you know, this is really, really great news for the world unless Britain decides to use this opportunity to get revenge. So it turns out we've gotten the vaccine and we'll be handing it out to all of our colonies, all of. Oh, well, that's right. You just want to be colonies anymore. Oh, look at that. I guess more vaccine for me. Oh, how you like that?

[00:02:01]
Now, India. So safety and precaution is fantastic, but there is one country who might be taking their precautions a little too far.

[00:02:09]
Belgium is putting a four person limit on holiday parties during the coronavirus pandemic. Officials say all gatherings must be held outdoors in a yard or garden, and only one guest will be allowed to enter the house to use the bathroom during the entire party. If you really have to go to the toilet, there will be nothing else to do but return home, said a government spokesperson.

[00:02:29]
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on. Only one person at the party is allowed to use the bathroom. That is a terrible idea. For starters, how do they decide who gets to be the designated bathroom user? How does the host tell you in advance they regulate your intake? Or do they just decide based on what you ate? And, you know, the worst part about not being able to use the bathroom is you lose your excuse for bailing on a conversation.

[00:02:52]
That's the only reason you go to the bathroom at a party. Now, you're just going to have to be honest. OK, well, thank you. Thank you. I've got to go. No, I don't have to use the bathroom. I just want to talk about your kids anymore. I hate them right now. I don't even know them. Of course, it's at least possible to practice social distancing at a garden party. You can try, but it's much more difficult at a sex party.

[00:03:12]
So when authorities in Belgium discovered that people were throwing an orgy in violation of the lockdown, police were sent to break it up. But that's when the real scandal began.

[00:03:24]
A Hungarian member of the European Parliament has resigned after breaking lockdown rules by attending what's been described as a gay sex party in Brussels. Yossef Sayah, who has previously backed anti LGBT legislation in Hungary, admitted attending the party, which was broken up by police.

[00:03:41]
The prosecution in Brussels have simply said that they were then raiding the party, which appeared to be breaking coronavirus lockdown restrictions. There are also reports in the Bulgarian media that he tried to run away from the party by climbing down a drain pipe and that he was then caught by the police in the street.

[00:04:01]
Damn, I can't believe a homophobic politician was caught at a gay sex party going down a drainpipe. And then he tried to escape at five. And by the way, being at an illegal sex party when the police stollman must be so awkward because you don't even realize it's a real police raid until it's too late. Think about it. You probably just assumed that somebody ordered stripper cops. Oh, yes, officer, I have been a really naughty boy while real handcuffs.

[00:04:30]
You take this seriously.

[00:04:32]
Oh, but yes, my friends, once again, another anti-gay politician has been caught in a gay sex scandal, which, by the way, there's nothing scandalous about gay sex. The scandal is that they said we're anti gay. Gay is bad. And it turns out they were doing it. And honestly, part of me feels bad for these politicians because clearly they've lived in a society that has made them so terrified of who they are and they hate themselves and the people that they go to these extreme lengths when they don't need to half the time.

[00:04:59]
It's not about family values. They just don't want somebody dating the ex. But let's move on to the latest news from outgoing President Donald Junk Food Trump because his plans to stay in the White House is not going smoothly. His lawsuits are failing. He hasn't been able to hide in the events. And now one of his most loyal supporters, Attorney General Booba, has said that there is no evidence of the widespread voter fraud that Trump has been screaming about.

[00:05:26]
And that's going to be especially humiliating for Trump, because you realize up until now, Bill Barr has always had his back. But now it's like, God, this must be like when you roll up at a bar fight like your you sorry ass bitch has done messed up, if you think you can take me and my boy Bill, your bill. Your bill. All right. Now, when I said sorry, I'm saying sorry ass bitches. But if Trump knows he's going to be dragged out of the White House soon, at least he's planning to do it in the Trump way possible.

[00:05:58]
Let's find out how Trump in another edition of Go Big and Go Home.

[00:06:09]
One of the weirdest quirks of being an American president is having the power to pardon anyone for any federal crimes, sort of like a cheat code for America's justice system. And it looks like President Trump is going to spend the next two months smashing those buttons.

[00:06:26]
President Trump may soon wield the power of the pardon in unprecedented ways. Multiple sources say the president is weighing whether to preemptively pardon family members and several of his close associates.

[00:06:37]
Among the names the president has discussed behind the scenes, the oldest three of his five children, Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka, as well as his son in law, Jared Kushner. Sources tell ABC News the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is also among those who in recent weeks directly asked President Trump for a preemptive pardon.

[00:06:55]
Though Giuliani denies it, let's just break down crystal clear what's being considered here. We're talking about pardons being issued before the president leaves office. For people who've not even been charged with the crime of preemptive get out of jail free card before a crime has even been committed, possibly for friends, family, even the president himself.

[00:07:12]
Oh, guys, that is adorable. Trump is pardoning his kids and his house pets, and he's not even pardoning them for anything specific. Trump is just handing out pardons like the gift cards. I figured I'd let you pick your own crime. So enjoy doing something crazy. Know live a little.

[00:07:30]
Of course, the big question now is, can Trump legally pardon himself? Because, see, no one knows for sure, but I actually want Trump to try it just because it's fun to see how he'll do it. He'll probably be in the mood like I hereby party. You know, I pardoned you step pointing at me. I'm trying to pardon you by your pardon. You show good looking, but you're pardoned. And before you say, oh, typical Donald Trump only in it for himself.

[00:07:59]
Well, hey, that's not true. It turns out that anyone may be able to get a pardon from Trump for the right price.

[00:08:06]
The White House is investigating a potential bribery scheme involving presidential pardons. It was revealed in heavily redacted court documents pertaining to a search warrant of several offices. The investigation seems to involve at least two individuals who, quote, acted as lobbyists to senior White House officials without registering as lobbyists, quote, to secure a pardon or reprieve of sentence for a person who appears to be known to investigators but whose name has been redacted in these newly unsealed documents. The investigation also involves an alleged offer from someone whose name had also been redacted of a, quote, substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence.

[00:08:54]
The documents do not name President Trump or any other White House officials, nor do they say whether anyone in the White House knew about the alleged scheme was.

[00:09:03]
Oh, so there was already controversy over Trump's pardons and now bribery might be involved as well. Basically, Trump managed to shove one of his scandals in the middle of another scandal. So impressive. Now, to be clear, all we know is that someone apparently offered to bribe Trump with a campaign contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon. We don't know if Trump actually pardon the guy. We don't know if he considered it or if you even heard about it.

[00:09:30]
All right. We don't know what Trump did. I will say this, though, after knowing him for this long, I think we can assume that my man is not going to turn down some pardon cash. If anything, I think we should be impressed that he hasn't started targeting Instagram ads to former felons. So that's where we are right now. President Trump is trying to stay in office, but if it doesn't work out, it looks like his plan is to just pardon everyone in his inner circle on his way out the door.

[00:09:55]
And whether that is constitutional or not, we don't know. But what I do know is Trump won't be trying to escape down a drain pipe at the next six party he gets busted at. Joke's on You is I pardoned myself.

[00:10:11]
All right, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, we'll find out why the housing system is rigged against black Americans. And Michael J. Fox is still joining us on the show.

[00:10:20]
So stick around. You know exactly where you were when the Golden State killer was arrested, you still pay for cable to get Lifetime. Your moderator on the Zodiac Killer separated. You're basically a seasoned detective and you're in search of a new challenge and or solve the hit podcast that puts you at the center of the investigation each week unsolved, you will untangle a case that has pushed detectives to their limits. Solve is like no other murder mystery podcast. You'll piece together evidence from interrogations, crime scenes and eyewitness testimony to track down killers hiding in plain sight.

[00:11:01]
Your cases are waiting for you. New episodes of Salt are available now on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts. One crime for suspects. Can you solve it? Welcome back to the daily social distancing show, so by now everyone knows the damage the coronavirus can do to your body, it can destroy your lungs, it can enjoy your kidneys, it can even take down your presidency. But it turns out the pandemic isn't just harming our bodies.

[00:11:34]
It's also harming our homes.

[00:11:37]
Are we headed for another mortgage crisis? The slow motion disaster in America's neighborhoods. With more than twenty one million Americans out of work, more and more homeowners are struggling to pay their mortgage.

[00:11:48]
We've seen a big spike in the number of delinquent homeowners since the pandemic began.

[00:11:53]
Right now, six point six percent of all mortgages are in some stage of delinquency. That's three point three million American homes nearly doubling in just nine months.

[00:12:04]
If we don't put money in people's pockets, if we don't extend a moratorium on evictions and mortgage foreclosures. We're going to be seeing millions of people who are homeless in the middle of winter when disease is rampant. We're going to see people who are being forced to go to work, even if they're sick, because they need to put food on the table and pay rent. And that is unconscionable.

[00:12:23]
Wow, guys, three point three million American homes is an insane number. That's like if everybody in Jamaica was suddenly homeless, I mean, they'd probably be chilled about it because they have so much great weed and great weather. But still, it would be very inconvenient. It's truly amazing that the American government's most powerful nation in the world has failed its people so badly. I mean, it almost feels like they tried to one up the damage Korona was doing.

[00:12:52]
I'm going to cause a massive public health crisis. Well, then we're going to cause a massive economic and housing crisis. Damn, you got a cold. But while the pandemic is causing millions to face a mortgage crisis for the first time, housing instability is nothing new for black people. In fact, it's something African-Americans have been dealing with long before the coronavirus. So let's find out why.

[00:13:16]
In another installment of If You Don't Know, now you know. It's no secret that white people have had an easier time getting ahead in America, but one of the most important reasons for this might surprise you.

[00:13:36]
For millions, owning a home remains at the heart of the American dream. But many black Americans have been left out.

[00:13:43]
A new report says just 44 percent of black families own a home, compared to 74 percent for whites.

[00:13:49]
Owning a home is the way that most people develop wealth. It is the way that for years and years and years, people have been able to pass something on to their their children or pay for their education. It's part of the reason the average white family has about 10 times the median wealth of a black family.

[00:14:06]
The gap between white and black homeowners is greater now than it was since before the Fair Housing Act of 1968, when segregation was legal.

[00:14:15]
That's right. The homeownership gap is worse for black people now than it was in segregation, which is insane. I never thought a black guy could be able to say Jim Crow. Those were the good old days. But it makes sense when you realize how owning real estate helps you build wealth and that wealth becomes generational because homeownership is one of the surest ways for families to pass down wealth. Not Beanie Babies, Grandma. But they're still very cute, save them for me, but also think about a portfolio.

[00:14:46]
So black Americans have had less wealth than white Americans for decades, and a large part of that was because they couldn't build wealth by owning a home. But why? Why couldn't they own homes at the same rates as white Americans? Well, like most things dealing with racial inequality, it starts with the governments.

[00:15:03]
During the New Deal, the Home Owners Loan Corporation refinanced more than a million loans, nearly one out of every five mortgages in urban America. Now, the main problem with the homeowner's loan corporation was redlining. All of that wonderful government finance was only available to white people.

[00:15:23]
The Homeowners Loan Corporation essentially did black people too risky to loan. The HLC created residential security maps where the term redlining comes from.

[00:15:32]
Green meant best area, best people, a.k.a. businessmen, blue men, good people like white collar families. Yellow meant a declining area with working class families and meant detrimental influences.

[00:15:46]
Most significantly, Negros saying that neighborhoods were hazardous to London because they were, quote unquote infiltrated by Negroes or threatened with Negro encroachment.

[00:15:58]
Man, what a terrible era. When the phrase infiltrated by Negroes could be a term used by the federal government when it should only be used for Dope Ass Mingo's album. I mean, seriously, do you know how fucked up it is to describe those neighborhoods as infiltrated by Negroes? That's where black people lived, but they made it sound like black people were breaking and entering into their own houses. Oh, shit.

[00:16:23]
I'm in my house. What am I doing? I live here like a part of me actually misses how up front racism was back in the days. You didn't have to read between the lines, you know, because if you're black now and you're trying to get a loan, they'll be like, well, we take a variety of factors into account. And the loan approval process back then, if a black person walked into a bank, the manager was just like, look, fellas, we've got a Negro encroaching white woman on the boat.

[00:16:46]
Come on, y'all.

[00:16:47]
Now, by the late 1960s, courts ruled that redlining was illegal. But there are more subtle ways that black people are still kept from purchasing houses, for example, real estate agents who are just really trying to keep neighborhoods, just white Newsday with an undercover project to see whether real estate agents treated prospective tenants who are black any differently than prospective tenants who are white.

[00:17:12]
And they did a lot of the risks to African-Americans in particular of suffering potential discrimination. It was about 50 50.

[00:17:22]
I've had agents invoke burning crosses to dissuade me from buying a home in certain areas.

[00:17:31]
This Newsday footage shows an agent handling one tester who is black and wants to see a house without a prequalification letter.

[00:17:39]
I want to try another person, but I don't have the time.

[00:17:44]
But for the white buyer also with no letter, what do you think about that when she shows that buyer to, in other cases, Newsday records agents who appear to be steering minorities towards mixed communities?

[00:17:56]
Every time I get a new listing, Bramlage or new clients finding these people, but with a white buyer, the same agent texting him about recent gang killings there, who?

[00:18:08]
Those real estate agents got caught. I would love to hear their feeble excuses afterwards. No, no, no. When I told one buyer the neighbors were nice people and the other one were gang killers, I meant they were nice gang killers, just jobs. And by the way, invoking burning crosses to try and stop a black person from moving into a neighborhood is not only racist, it's overkill. If you wanna stop a black person from moving into a home.

[00:18:31]
All you gotta do is tell them that their next door neighbor as raisins to their potato salad, they're out. And the truth is that even though redlining was outlawed as a matter of official policy, it sure looks like the banks are still doing it anyway.

[00:18:43]
Lenders deny mortgages for black applications at a rate 80 percent higher than that of white applicants.

[00:18:50]
When we do get loans or at much higher interest rates, much worse conditions, if you're African-American making more than one hundred thousand dollars, you are more likely to be put into a subprime loan than if you were a white person making less than thirty five thousand dollars.

[00:19:03]
Consequently, black and brown families were disproportionately impacted by the 2007 2010 housing crisis, being nearly twice as likely as white families to lose their homes after controlling for education, crime, walkability, homes in black neighborhoods are devalued by twenty three percent and accumulatively that's about one hundred and fifty six billion in lost equity.

[00:19:23]
One couple in Florida actually saw their appraisal increase by 40 percent after they removed any evidence that a black woman lived there.

[00:19:31]
I took down the family pictures that we had in the home and basically any markers that there were African-Americans living in the house, replacing them only with photos of her husband and his white family.

[00:19:45]
When the second appraisal comes back, the value of their house shot up more than one hundred thousand dollars.

[00:19:52]
Think about that. Her home appraisal went up a hundred thousand dollars, one hundred thousand dollars, getting rid of her family photos and more for her home value than putting in a swimming pool. And again, can we all agree that this is racist?

[00:20:07]
Yeah, because just having pictures of black family members shouldn't drive down the value of a house just because you have pictures of black people. I mean, unless that black person is Arkley, then it's like, I don't care that the basement is spacious. I know what was happening in there. So when it comes to racial discrimination in housing, America has come a long way and there's still a long way to go. But until the government gets serious about racial discrimination in mortgage lending and home selling, well, Leo DeBelin has got you covered.

[00:20:38]
Are you trying to sell your home but can't get a good price because you black, you're trying to get a new house, but these real estate agents are keeping you in the poorhouse, pecked at moving vacant because Leo's got a plan introducing Leo Devlins home right of vacation.

[00:20:57]
I'll make your house look so white. Yeah. Think what's a decent living this bitch out.

[00:21:04]
Throw out all your family photos and replace them with water colors and boats. I'll even throw in a diploma from Dartmouth art history.

[00:21:14]
You know, that's why your library is going to get whitefly too, with David Sedaris The Life of Pi and of course, How to Be Anti-racist by April Kindie. Oh, that's why not.

[00:21:29]
And nothing, says white, like adding the exposed brick.

[00:21:34]
Yeah, that's rustic as hell, I'll even widefield your garage swap out that two thousand five hundred civic flat tire, a pair of skis and a volleyball net that only got used once looking like a L.L. Bean catalog in this interview order.

[00:21:52]
Now, I want to follow your music collection by making the style, you know, Barbara Streisand, Leo Develin, whole modification with eighty five dollars.

[00:22:02]
I get that from your mama for application and I follow it to 120 by the fairgrounds next to Footlocker.

[00:22:17]
All right. When we come back, I'll be talking with author Brooke Bennett about writing one of the top books of Twenty Twenty. And then Michael J. Fox joins us on the show. Stick around.

[00:22:28]
My name is Lowell Berlanti and I created the podcast Prodigy to find the answer to a very complicated question. Can genius be created? I asked academics, researchers, scientists and the prodigies themselves to gain a better understanding of intelligence, skill acquisition and expert performance. So disregard all simple explanations because complex questions require complex answers. Listen to Prodigy every Thursday on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or ever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:23:07]
So earlier today, I spoke with best selling author Brooke Bennett's. We had a fascinating conversation about her critically acclaimed novel that explores the American history of black people who pass as white. Brooke Bennett, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:23:22]
Hi, thanks for having me. You are truly one of the most prolific writers of our time. And once again, you have written a book that is ascended to the top of The New York Times. And not only that, got into a bidding war where HBO topped out 17 other people, 17 other companies that wanted the rights to this book and HBO wanted out. How does it feel for yourself to have 20, 20 be a great year when it really is like a dismal year?

[00:23:49]
Because it is. It is like that for many people. This some great moments and it's in the midst of this year. Are you just going to lie and say all the good things to happen in twenty, twenty one?

[00:23:58]
I know it feels it feels so wild and it feels so obvious to say that because I think that's true of everybody that this has been such a surreal year. But I think for me, I felt so just lucky to have experienced these highs and to have experienced such a warm reception for this book.

[00:24:13]
Your your book, The Vanishing Half, is truly one of the most amazing stories. You've set the story in the Jim Crow South world that has come into D.C., let's say. So it's 50 years ago and it's the story of twin sisters who run away from home and then go into a world where although there are twins, there are identical twins. One of them is lighter than the other. And so she chooses a pop when she passes as white.

[00:24:39]
And that is literally the jumping off point of the story where I won't lie. When I first read it, I was like, oh, this is going to be a book about racism in the South or slavery or things like, OK, no, no, no, it's about Jim Crow, but it's all there's going to be a white man who is like, no, I haven't read many stories like this. It was a beautiful book about black people tackling the issues of race and colorism and the ideas.

[00:25:03]
Why did you choose to frame it like that? It was a really interesting idea.

[00:25:06]
I mean. Well, thank you. First of all, I think for me, I wanted to write a story about those nuances within a black community. I think sometimes there's a tendency to think that the more interesting story is, is conflict between black and white people. But for me, really, I've always said the most interesting thing to happen to black people is not necessarily white people. Often the more interesting stories and the more complicated stories are within our own community.

[00:25:30]
So I wanted to to think about the effect of colorism, which is a result of white supremacy, and it's a result of that type of ideology. But what does this color ism do to people and how does it affect the choices that these characters are able to make in their lives?

[00:25:44]
Yeah, I mean, I grew up in a country where literally Shades determined your life. You know, I'm seen as being during apartheid. It was like I'm technically superior to my mom and I'm inferior to my dad. And yet we're all in the same family. And what I loved about this book is you write in a way with the characters themselves, start to understand how people perceiving them can determine their way in life. When you think about race and when you were writing about it in the book, is it interesting to rewrite the story of like a ridiculous thing that was created and then like try to figure out the rules through the eyes of these characters?

[00:26:22]
I think that that was one of the things that was so interesting to me was the absurdity of all of it, the absurdity of these rules, the idea of what does it even mean to be black if it's not looking quote unquote, looking black, what does it actually mean for these characters to be black or to be white? To what degree are they performing race and how are they sort of creating or deconstructing themselves in a different way? So I think writing this book and which is takes this idea of colorism and really pushes it to a very extreme.

[00:26:53]
But looking at it from that really extreme lens gave me a way to kind of see the absurdity of race in all of its all of its nuances even now. And when I'm growing up and when I'm alive, which is a very different time period, then the book is set.

[00:27:07]
Oftentimes when we read stories, especially in the black community of a black person trying to pass as white, that stories written from a place of judgment. Oh, of course, you want to act like you white. You want to act like you better, you want to escape, you want to be better than us. And in this story was more like just a person going like, hey, man, I've made these decisions. I grapple with them.

[00:27:24]
And as a reader, we're just forced to live with them, grappling with that. Why did you choose to write it in such a way where it's like there's no there's no you judging, it's just you portraying what they're going through?

[00:27:36]
Yeah. I mean, I think you're right. I think a lot of passing stories are very moralizing. The idea that the character passes is deserving of punishment, often death. And a lot of these stories. And I think for me, first, I just didn't find that interesting to to condemn somebody or to ask is it good or is it bad to pass? That was just not an interesting question. But I think also there's a weird way in which those stories kind of reaffirm the racial hierarchy by punishing a character who has transgressed in some way.

[00:28:04]
So I objected to it from a level of interest kind of standpoint, but also from a kind of political and moral standpoint, I wasn't interested in judging these characters. I just wanted to think about what are the what do you gain and what do you lose in deciding to become somebody new and to leave your community behind and create a whole new identity?

[00:28:23]
Well, I honestly, I understand why 17 media companies were bidding for the rights to your book. I should have jumped in and made it 18 cents because really, you've written a masterpiece. Congratulations. There's a reason it was a bestseller. There's a reason it's going to be turned into an amazing movie or TV series, whatever it is. You've done a phenomenal job once again. And I can't wait to read your writing over and over and over and over again.

[00:28:49]
Thank you so much for joining me on the show. Thank you so much. Thanks. Thank you. Look after yourself.

[00:28:54]
Don't forget the vanishing Hoffe is available. Now, stick around, because when we come back, the legendary Michael J. Fox is joining me on the show.

[00:29:01]
You don't miss it. Personal growth is challenging, but it doesn't have to be hard when we lean in to self inquiry and self discovery, we're able to love all the tiny little parts of us, even the pieces we don't want other people to know about.

[00:29:18]
And that's what it's really about, right? Self-love, self acceptance, self discovery, excavation expansion. We are the powerful cocreator of our lives. All we need are the tools to get there. I'm Debbie Brown, the host of the Dropping Gems podcast, a podcast about the depth and potential personal growth.

[00:29:41]
No one's journey is the same as the next, but the magic of being human shows up in the things we have in common our capacity for love, pain, joy, sadness, togetherness and solitude are things that make us perfectly imperfect. And I want to explore with you how we can live our best through it all. New season of Dropping Gems is available now. Listener dropping gems on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I had the honor of speaking with award winning actor and Parkinson's advocate Michael J. Fox. We talked about his enduring legacy, writing his fourth memoir and the most difficult year that almost caused him to abandon hope. Michael J.

[00:30:28]
Fox, welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show and nice to not be there.

[00:30:37]
If I'm not mistaken, this is your third time technically on The Daily Show in all iterations. Correct.

[00:30:44]
Got my my 20 something years ago and it's my first time you may see it.

[00:30:48]
Host Well, I had it with Greg Kinnear and Jon Stewart and you so you do well so far. I like how you say it like it's a conquest.

[00:31:02]
That's how you said you like you might you my Daily Show host to see what the fourth is going to bring. You know, it makes sense that it's your third Daily Show host and it makes sense that you've been on every single show because you've been show business. You have the years when you were the young guy who was just doing everything and was amazing. But now you're the guy who's still doing amazing things. But you've got this amazing journey with Parkinson's is what we've raised more money than anybody in the world fighting against the disease.

[00:31:26]
When you look at your life, where do you see your achievements or is it just one story?

[00:31:30]
I don't know. I don't really think in those terms. I'm just glad to be here. I was happy to have to be around. But I don't remember once when I moved to California was 18 and then was going to show them to myself back in the future myself, married and defend myself with the child in Parkinson's Disease and and another series. And seems like life just goes like that. And and it's it's cool if you take notes on the way, but it's it's it's it's been a whirlwind.

[00:31:58]
So I don't know. I mean, I loved I loved being twenty three and driving my Ferrari an hour and the cigarette like craziness in the life when I see myself like sitting on the back porch with my dog watching rabbits run across the yard, neither one of us wanted to chase and can't think about that kid standing in the barn, Hollywood leading his troops in a different life. I feel like.

[00:32:24]
Yeah, I feel like you've lived many lives, you know, and I think it's only fitting that you've written another memoir. I think this is your fourth one now. But in the book, what I really found endearing and it makes you want to laugh and at times what makes you want to cry is you share how hard it is to stay optimistic. You know, you share moments where you go like actually, I don't know if I'm optimistic every day.

[00:32:43]
Actually, I am depressed, actually. It's like Parkinson's sucks. Actually, life isn't always easy. Talk me through why you decided to write a book that had like a different tone to what we've heard from you so much in the past.

[00:32:55]
I had such a cranky look at me, but I'm a little cranky but cranky man I was joking to kind of. But what happened was I with Parkinson's, I've reached kind of detente where that I just like it is the case. It the Roomba takes up. I do other stuff and then I just deal with it that way. And that is an optimistic point of view. It's just going to say glass half full. I mean, it sounds cool and and can you do it that way?

[00:33:21]
Then they get this thing, which is a tumor on my spine, which they defend. They said this is going to paralyze you, Schreuder. We get to get up. I guess you want to take it out of this doctor in Baltimore, Johns Hopkins. I don't consider who's great who said, I'll take it up. I can tell you why it you want to pay it out because you must be the guy who paralyzes Michael J. Fox.

[00:33:44]
I said that's where the balls to say that to me. I you the guy, he's a nice and easy Deschutes and that was fine. I will we learn to walk again. I mean literally learning the mechanics and the walking in and all that stuff and finally got to where I'm sure to get to finally get to where was alone. That's the first time in months I had no AIDS, no hanging on me. And I was walking in the hallway in my apartment feeling like a big shot, walking into the kitchen, sit on a tile floor in the shadow of my tumors and and mutilate it.

[00:34:18]
And and I was laying on the floor with my alarm. And he put a pretty shiny face on this. Make this happy.

[00:34:28]
This is this is just sex is only sex, sex and more than that, that it sucks because this is not good. And they begin a whole conversation. It should have been about. But had it been had I like.

[00:34:42]
Put up optimism, panacea, had I said today, we agreed we had a commodify hope, right. And I had make this a thing and it's not a thing. It's something you feel you arrive at. It's an optimism. It's an action. It's not a worry. It's not a bad idea. I started to look at what what brought me optimism. The first one was about optimism. That was what is my default mode? Get the standard for me.

[00:35:14]
And I did things I found myself thinking about, which all of you fear and just opportunity. And and when I came to his acceptance. Gratitude. If you if you if you granted in everything some peace of gratitude that some element of something and activism survives.

[00:35:38]
Wow, because it's easier for you to get to.

[00:35:40]
Before I let you go, I wanted to talk to you about the work that you have done that I think few human beings would even dream of being able to do in any field. And that is I think you've put over a billion dollars into Parkinson's research. You've helped raise this money.

[00:35:53]
Do you do you know how close we are to seeing a cure? And do you think that we'll see a cure within your lifetime? What are some of the leaps that you've seen in the work that you've done that have given you hope?

[00:36:05]
I don't know that it'll make a big difference in my life because I am basically 20 miles in a car already. I mean, I'm one of those babies that we get from the new engine. It is hard. And we do realize that if you told me 20 years is a billion dollars and not have the cure yet, when I started, I said, I hope we say this, but because we've done in 20 years, it really is really important work and excessive access to data.

[00:36:35]
Whether it's so we have to think of the biomarker initiative. We're also finding new ways to to to get in the brain to to to get visuals to to get to be able to see where how a protein that and damages to the brain tissue. So that image. And so so we work on all these big problems in one day that is going to be like this is the right combination of glue and honeycombs going to make it all happen.

[00:37:15]
I like that. That's the best description for science. One day the glue in the pinecones, we'll meet and we'll have the cure for what we need. Thank you for taking the time. Thank you for making me your first Daily Show host. And thank you for being my first Michael J. Fox. I appreciate you send my love to the family and we'll we'll have you back for the fifth memoir. Don't break any more arms. Look after yourself.

[00:37:40]
Yeah. All right, thank you so much. Appreciate it. No time like the future is available now. And you can go to Michael J. Fox dot org to learn about his work to eliminate Parkinson's disease. That's our show for tonight.

[00:37:56]
But before we go, as you may have heard, there is an important runoff election coming up in Georgia. And if you're watching this from the Peach State, the deadline to register to vote online for that election is next Monday, December 7th. Now, if you're not in Georgia, you can still help out by supporting groups like 18 by votes that are trying to work to engage young people to vote, especially the estimated twenty three thousand young people in Georgia who were not eligible to vote in the general election but are eligible to vote now in January 5th.

[00:38:23]
So if you are able to help out and you want to support the cause, then please check out the link below until tomorrow. Stay safe out there, wear a mask and remember, if you're going to an illegal sex party first, make sure that your drainpipe can support your weight.
