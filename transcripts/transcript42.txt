Boston, home to Mark Wahlberg, Donnie Wahlberg, it all, all the rest of the world works. It's also home to spotlight the team of Boston Globe reporters who exposed the city's church sex scandal. I'm here because the Spotlight team has been asking another uncomfortable question how racist is Boston? For decades, people have called Boston racist for numerous reasons. The Red Sox were the last baseball team to integrate. Bostonians violently resisted desegregation even in twenty. Seventeen fans at Fenway Park called Adam Jones the N-word.

[00:01:10]
And all this got Spotlight Kiri's reporter Akela Johnson.

[00:01:15]
So we wanted to look at why does Boston have the racist reputation and why does it deserve it?

[00:01:20]
How do you measure racism while you do it right? How many times the N-word is said in a day?

[00:01:28]
Yeah, it's like a new barometer.

[00:01:32]
No inwardness, no.

[00:01:34]
OK, so one study we found showed that the median net worth of white families in Boston was two hundred and forty seven thousand five hundred dollars. Compare that to the median net worth of black families in Boston, which was eight dollars a continent.

[00:01:49]
Thousands like eight thousand dollars. No, just eight eight dollars. Eight dollars. That's that's not even a Grundy's soy latte.

[00:01:57]
In essence, net worth is what you own minus what you owe. And black folks in Boston don't own a lot.

[00:02:05]
That's not even enough for a law degree.

[00:02:10]
No, racism is more than just attitudes and even enough to buy a 12, not 11 donut. This is one example of what structural racism looks like.

[00:02:21]
I'm sorry. I eat when I get sad about social inequality. If Boston is the cradle of equality, Spotlit wants to know why black enrollment at many of Boston's universities hasn't really gone up in thirty years, or why there's so little diversity in boardrooms and hospitals, or how among eight major cities, black people voted Boston, the least welcoming to people of color. Surely the people of Boston must be feeling all that structural racism. To find out, I went to one of the city's most beloved cathedrals, Fenway Park.

[00:02:58]
I don't see that racism myself. Honestly, no, I don't think Boston's a racist city. I think that we've got a lot of, like, attention with with our sports being in the media.

[00:03:06]
So Boston's racist reputation is a conspiracy formed by people who hate Boston sports teams for winning all the damn time. Yes, they love to hate us. Yeah, I don't think Boston is a racist city at all. So how do you know? I don't feel it, you know, it's just a gut feel, I don't feel like it's racist, I've just never encountered it.

[00:03:30]
The spotlight says the city has a race problem. Why haven't these Bostonians seen it? The NAACP, Tanisha Sullivan, has a theory.

[00:03:38]
The spotlight gave us data to support what black people in and around this city already knew.

[00:03:45]
So if the data was news to you, you called the article the Spotlight article, but if you already knew about it, you just called it. That's what I've been trying to tell your article, because the racism is not as overt.

[00:04:00]
It's difficult for people who don't experience it on a day to day basis to realize that it's there. I get it.

[00:04:08]
I've been asking the wrong people. If you want to know if Jurassic Park is safe, you don't ask the dinosaurs.

[00:04:13]
It's not as racist as it used to be. But there are some blatant problems. A white person walks into a room and they don't want to think about that. I'm the only white person here.

[00:04:20]
On a scale of Jazzy Jeff. To Jeff Sessions, how uncomfortable is it for black people to want to stop?

[00:04:28]
Because Crow was Jeff Sessions right there. So that's the song, about 60, 70 percent comfortable? Not quite. Hey, boy, go home, but definitely know your neighborhood, know where you are allowed, know where you want to.

[00:04:45]
Hard to fix a problem. You can't seem to help the city recognize structural racism. Maybe I just need to use the one thing that brings all Bostonians together. Sports, sports, sports folks, probably both teams were winners. What we do, I just need to get the city of champions hyped about finally winning at the one thing they suck at. We're about treat people with respect. What city treat black people. This is Atlanta, actually, and then New York.

[00:05:15]
And then San Francisco. And then Charlotte. Tampa. And then at the bottom is Boston. What these people really needed was a mascot. So I gave them one. Introducing Willke the Walrus. We've got the best baseball player who's got the best football. Well, no one in the system with a truly bright people don't always get the same opportunities. Yes, it's working already. It feels good, to be honest, fighting structural racism is going to be exhausting.
