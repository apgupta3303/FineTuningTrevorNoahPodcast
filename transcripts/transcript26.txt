[00:00:42]
I'm Trevor Noah. This is the Daily Social Distancing Show. And today is February 2nd, also known as day two of Black History Month. So let's party people bust out some of that sweet black history music.

[00:00:55]
We do what we didn't know anyway on tonight's show.

[00:01:04]
Another reason you might not want to get on a plane. What Reddit learned from watching Wall Street and Biden. Better have my money. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:13]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah. Here's a. Before we get started, today is Groundhog Day, which leads me to ask, what the hell is Groundhog Day?

[00:01:38]
People put a rodents out of the ground and then ask the animal to predict the weather. Really, this is so unfair, because if Africans were doing shit like this and you heard that we pulled animals out of the ground, like there are villages in Africa where people wear animal skin. And if I try to explain to them that Americans use groundhogs to predict the weather, they'd be like, but why not use satellite data? But let's move on from talking animals to e-mailing vegetables.

[00:02:02]
It sounds too crazy to believe scientists really have taught spinach to send emails.

[00:02:09]
All right, here's how it works. Just break it down to engineers at MIT report that spinach roots can detect a compound found in explosives like landmines. When the roots detect the compound, molecules in the roots release a signal. That signal is then read by an infrared camera, which sends an email alert to scientists. The purpose of the experiment is to detect explosives, but scientists believe it could be used to warn researchers of pollution. The experiment is part of a wider field of research that involves engineering electronic systems in the plants.

[00:02:42]
It is also called Plant Nano Bionics.

[00:02:46]
All right. I'm sorry, guys. This is insane. I mean, who emails anymore? Just DM me spinach. Seriously, spinach, DM me.

[00:02:59]
But you also know what this means. If spinach just got on e mail, it means that they're not as savvy about it as everyone else. So let me be the first to say Gretchen's my dearest friend, Spinach. I have a million dollars in interest that I suddenly cannot access until the deal much. If you are able to allow me to a thousand dollars, I will pay you back 15 times over. Please, spinach, I need you. And now we play the waiting game.

[00:03:32]
But Congressman, congratulations to the scientists who are working on this breakthrough. And now that they've told spinach how to send them email, maybe they can move on to the next scientific frontier. Teaching your mom how to use face time.

[00:03:44]
How do I turn the camera?

[00:03:47]
Mom, I've got to go. Just ask the spinach. Moving on to the coronavirus pandemic.

[00:03:52]
It's the reason sweatpants on our business expense. Yesterday, Western Australia went into total lockdown after discovering its first coronavirus case in 10 months. You see, Australia is very different from the United States in the US. Water goes down the drain clockwise and in Australia they care about stopping coronavirus. Now, part of the reason for Australia's success is that Australians don't resist the government as much when they tell them that they should stay at home. And it's partly because these people know that covid is a serious disease.

[00:04:26]
It's also partly because it lets Australians stay away from all the other things in Australia that could kill them. And it's bad enough that the scorpions and snakes are trying to kill me. But there's a koala that's trying to get me an ashtray. Now, eventually, of course, the world will reemerge from the pandemic.

[00:04:43]
And I know everyone thinks that they're going to jump right back into their old lives, you know, like going to bars or theatres or using the bottom half of your face to express emotion. But you might want to prepare for a period of adjustment because some things apparently take a little time to relearn.

[00:05:02]
A new report says some pilots are getting rusty on the job due to the pandemic because, well, there are fewer planes to fly. Some pilots grounded for months by the pandemic have seen the skills and proficiency suffer. For instance, one pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake, damaging a tow truck that was trying to pull that plane from the gate. In another case, the pilot, while forgot to turn on the anti icing mechanism. Other reports include lining up the wrong runway for landing.

[00:05:34]
To counter such rustiness, the FAA stops pilots from flying a commercial jet unless they have performed at least three takeoffs and three landings, either on a plane or in a simulator in the previous 90 days.

[00:05:48]
I don't know about you, but this is kind of scary. Apparently, you never forget how to ride a bike, but you forget how to fly a plane after like five days. Oh, man, this is going to change everything. Next time the plane hits turbulence, the pilot's going to jump on the intercom like, are there any hijackers on board?

[00:06:05]
We need someone who knows how to fly the plane. Harpreet, any hijackers, please make yourself known to the cabin crew.

[00:06:10]
And listen, I get that pilots are human and everyone makes mistakes at their jobs, but there are certain jobs where there is way less room for error. You know, like as a mail carrier, you might say, oh, whoops, this package was supposed to go to apartment two and accidentally sent it to apartment three. But as a pilot, it's more like a whoopsies. These people were supposed to go to Miami and I accidentally sent them to heaven and trust me now, this is not just going to be pilots, people, everyone is going to be rusty off to covid projectionists are going to be showing movies upside down.

[00:06:40]
Bouncers are going to be letting in groups of ugly dudes and telling beautiful women they got on the wrong shoes. Bullies are going to give you their lunch money. Meanwhile, until the pandemic is actually over, Americans are going to need more help getting through it. And the big question of what that help will look like is dominating Washington, D.C. right now.

[00:07:00]
President Biden's pledge of bipartisanship facing its first test tonight. The president inviting 10 Republican senators to the Oval Office to pitch their covid relief counteroffer. Their six hundred billion dollar proposal is a mere fraction of the president's one point nine trillion dollar package. The GOP plan leaves out a minimum wage boost. The president includes and whittles down his fourteen hundred dollar direct payments to Americans to one thousand dollars.

[00:07:28]
Still, when all was said and done. The White House did not appear to be conceding much ground, saying the president will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.

[00:07:36]
This is a sign of this effort from President Biden to get bipartisanship here. But it also comes as Democrats on Capitol Hill are paving the way to move forward with only Democratic votes for this relief package.

[00:07:49]
Look, man, I'm not going to lie. I get why Democrats and Republicans are having trouble agreeing on this relief package. I mean, this is a difference of one point three trillion dollars. How do you compromise when you're that far apart? It's like deciding what you want to get for dinner and you want something nice, but your date wants to eat out of a gas station, trash can. You can't compromise and eat out of a nice trash can.

[00:08:12]
But I also do love how Republicans suddenly get stingy the second that a Democrat comes into office, because don't forget, during the Trump years, they were handing out tax cuts with a strip of money gun. But now that Biden is president, suddenly they're trying to hand out covid relief a penny at a time, one penny to OpenEdge. Am I making it rain yet? Three pennies? Yes. More of a drizzle. I agree. Now, a lot of people are upset about the Democrats plan to give people fourteen hundred dollars because they say that the Democrats promised to give people two thousand dollars.

[00:08:48]
But the Democrats are arguing that everybody already got the first six hundred a month ago. And I get the Democrats point on this one. But at the same time, so many people are struggling right now. Why not just give them twenty six hundred instead? I mean, you can find the money somewhere. Just take it from spaceports. Trump is gone. We don't have to pretend that that's a thing anymore. And finally, let's move on to the second.

[00:09:08]
Most talked about Instagram video from last night's Ofter Courtside Karen The Post by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who gave a harrowing account of her personal experience during the capital attack.

[00:09:22]
We're getting an eye opening new look inside last month's siege on the US Capitol. Ocasio Cortez describing the impact of the riots, sharing details about what happened to her during the insurrection at the Capitol, telling her viewers she felt like she was going to die.

[00:09:36]
All of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on my door like this, like I'm here. And the bathroom door starts going like this, like the bathroom door is behind me or rather in front of me. And I'm like this. And the door hinges right here.

[00:09:55]
And I just hear, where is she? Where is she?

[00:10:00]
And this was the moment where. I thought everything was over, you know, I just happened to. You know, be a spiritual person and be raised in that context, and I really just felt like, you know. If this is the plan for me. Then people will be able to take it from here. Wow. You know, for a lot of us at home, the capital riots were basically an action movie on TV. I mean, it was scary, intense and terrifying, but at the end of the day, we were just watching it.

[00:10:43]
But an action movie is very different when you are actually in the movie. I mean, AOC and other members of Congress literally thought that they were going to die on a Wednesday afternoon, no less. I mean, nobody should die in the middle of the week. That means you went to work on Monday and Tuesday for nothing. And thank God that no members of Congress were actually hurt. But even just believing that you're going to die is a major trauma.

[00:11:07]
And ABC handled it way better than I would have. I mean, she was like, if this is where my journey ends, so be it. If I thought about it, I wouldn't be pondering my journey. I'd be trying to delete my browser history. And to everyone out there who's saying, oh, how scared could she really have been? How scared could she have been? Think about how terrified you get when someone knocks on the bathroom door when there isn't even a riot.

[00:11:32]
So once you hear, oh, God, no, they're going to know that I poop. So I'm glad that ABC shed the story because many Republicans in Congress would like to just pretend that this shit never happened, that the lives of Congress members and their staff weren't in danger, and that police officers guarding the Capitol weren't injured and killed. But if there's no accountability, then it becomes easier and easier for it to happen again. And the last thing we need from this action movie is a sequel.

[00:12:00]
Right. When we come back, we'll look at why hedge funds are so mad about the GameStop uprising. And Ibrahim Scandi is joining us on the show.

[00:12:08]
So don't go away. I've got one word for you, Tom Cruise, on this new weekly podcast meeting, Tom Cruise, we're going to talk about Tom Cruise. We're going to talk to people who have met Tom Cruise. Why? Because Tom Cruise is the greatest movie star of all time. Is he, though? Shut your mouth. Everyone who has met him has an amazing story to tell. And that's where he met Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise.

[00:12:30]
When I hear the bathroom door open and it's Tom Cruise. Hey, everybody, I'm Jeff Meacham. You might know me as Josh Open Hole from TV's Blackfish. And I'm here with the ghost of my maverick. Hey, I'm Joel Johnston. You might know me as Archie and the marvelous Mrs.. And I'm Alec Lev. And you know, no one knows you from anything. Listen, we love Tom Cruise. We are inspired by Tom Cruise. But while we live and work in Hollywood, we've never actually met Tom Cruise.

[00:12:53]
So we're going to talk to some people who have and maybe one of them will lead us to the man himself so we can have our own. Of meeting Tom Cruise does really have to, Jessica, about Tom Cruise. What are you here? Listen to meeting Tom Cruise on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.

[00:13:13]
Hi, this is Bill Clinton.

[00:13:14]
Please join me on my podcast. Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this for conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know. We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future. Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.

[00:13:43]
Welcome back to the daily social distancing show. By now, you've probably heard about the GameStop uprising, the biggest thing to happen with video games since Sonic got busted for doping. But if you haven't heard the news, what happened was that some Wall Street hedge funds bets a lot of money that the stock price of the video game store GameStop would fall. But a bunch of people on Reddit found out about those bets. So they started buying GameStop shares so that the price would go up and the hedge funds would lose a lot of money and lose a lot of money they did in the billions of dollars.

[00:14:16]
So as you can imagine, Wall Street is pretty unhappy with those Reddit investors.

[00:14:22]
A handful of industry leaders are calling for an investigation because of the angry mob that's formed against them.

[00:14:29]
Last week was a free market. It was a free for all market, no doubt about it.

[00:14:34]
For my twenty five years in the business, I've never seen this form of collusion on such a widespread fashion. This type of behavior is not the behavior that you want to be replicating. I think there is something obviously wrong, and it's the gamification of Wall Street.

[00:14:50]
Talk to an analyst this morning, guys. He said this is dangerous. They forget they're buying a stock in a piece of a company. It's not just some symbol that you play hot potato with it.

[00:14:59]
Just because you throw the Hail Mary pass in your back yard and it's caught for the touchdown in the wind. Doesn't mean you're Tom Brady.

[00:15:07]
What's going through my mind is how irrelevant I feel and how every day I just don't want to get out of bed and how it's the least amount of fun I think I've ever had. Oh, man.

[00:15:18]
These Wall Street guys are taking this so hard that the interviews are just turning into therapy sessions.

[00:15:24]
I feel so irrelevant right now and I'm not having any fun. And I just remembered my parents never hung my paintings on the refrigerator.

[00:15:33]
But the truth is, what the Rediscuss did here is nothing new. In fact, the only thing that makes this so unique is that this is just the first time that the little guy has used the big guys tactics against him, because when it comes to manipulating the market and treating trades like a game, no one is better at it than Wall Street. I mean, they do this shit all the time. In fact, let's take a look at a few examples, starting with a scam one big bank pulled just a few years ago.

[00:15:59]
The New York Times reporting over the weekend that Goldman Sachs is running a scheme to artificially inflate aluminum prices.

[00:16:06]
An aluminum warehouse controlled by Goldman Sachs holds the equivalent of a quarter of the annual North American demand for the metal, but only offloads or distributes a required minimum of three thousand tons a day. No more, no less. Whatever the demand, pushing prices of the metal higher even as demand has declined. Goldman profits from this practice two ways.

[00:16:28]
First, from the extended rents paid to store the metal, and second, by the bets made on aluminum futures by its trading arm.

[00:16:34]
The inflated aluminum pricing by Goldman and other financial players has cost American consumers five billion dollars over the last four years.

[00:16:43]
Yeah, that's right. Basically, Goldman Sachs manipulated the supply of aluminum by only letting out a little bit at a time. You know, the same way Daniel Day Lewis limits the supply of movies, isn't it? I mean, the dude's only been in six movies over the past twenty years. The Rock made that many movies yesterday. Get to work.

[00:17:02]
Danny, by the way, for the rest of the segment, I'm going to be pronouncing its aluminum, even though the correct pronunciation is aluminium. But we had a vote and all the people I work with our American. And so they won. And I didn't want to accept the election result. But then I was like, no, we don't want to do that again. And I'm sorry, guys, but aluminum should never be hoarded. It needs to be used the way God intended to make condoms for robots or for major retail.

[00:17:28]
Green to wear is a hat. And believe it or not, Goldman Sachs got away with the scheme for years until people caught onto it. So I guess you could say that their aluminum plan. Was foiled, wow, brown, brown, brown.

[00:17:48]
Now, as crazy as this is, it's actually a common tactic with Wall Street. You take over a market and then manipulated supply to drive up the price. Like how JP Morgan used its control over electricity to fleece California.

[00:18:01]
JPMorgan Chase accused of manipulating energy prices and so driving up the electric bills of millions of Americans that night when energy prices are very low, essentially, they would bid them up so that in the morning the companies would go to buy energy and find the prices artificially high, takes a few hours to get a power plant going. So they would have to buy the energy in the morning when it was very, very expensive. In one case, JPMorgan duped California utilities into paying nine hundred ninety nine dollars per megawatt hour when the going rate was only twelve dollars.

[00:18:35]
Yo, this shit is crazy. It's like these guys were sitting around a table like I'm tired of just abusing our power metaphorically. Let's do it for real. Basically, because of JPMorgan, the cost of electricity went up from twelve dollars per megawatt to almost a thousand dollars per megawatt. Even Amish people were like, Yo, I don't even know what electricity is, but that shit is messed up. I hope the Amish community doesn't come off to me on Twitter for that one.

[00:19:01]
I mean, at that price, I would actually be less upset if you jumped me and robbed me. At least then it feels like you had to work for it. And the truth is, this isn't something hedge fund people are ashamed of. In fact, some of them even brag about it on the TV.

[00:19:17]
Jim Cramer once made a fortune running a successful hedge fund. He went on to host his own TV show, Mad Money, that offers stock tips to investors. But as Cramer has found out lately, a lot of Americans are mad at him. This video, made in 2006, has suddenly gone viral. Cramer explains to his own financial website, The Street Dotcom, how he could influence stock prices up and down as the manager of a massive hedge fund.

[00:19:41]
You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money, but it's a fun game and it's a lucrative game. And I would encourage anyone who's in the hedge fund to do it because it's legal and it is a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. But by the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that.

[00:20:10]
But I didn't care. These people got no shame, no shame. Zero, nada, zilch. He's just out here boasting about his evil plans. I mean, the only people who do that are hedge fund guys and bond villains. I mean, listen to him, listen to him talk about it. It's legal and it's very satisfying. Just as a general rule, whenever you have to remind someone that something is legal, it's probably shady.

[00:20:35]
You know, no one's ever like, hey, Trevor, you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory? It's legal. But when it comes to hurting people in order to make a buck, nothing compares to the Great Recession of 2008, which was caused by guess who?

[00:20:50]
Wall Street manipulating the markets during the hot housing market, banks took millions of home mortgages, many held by people who could not afford them and bundled them into packages as mortgage securities. JPMorgan today admitted that it sold those packages to investors, even though its executives knew that many of the mortgages were highly suspect. When the market collapsed, those packages became mostly worthless.

[00:21:13]
Goldman sold investors subprime mortgage packages, but then made its own bet those same investments would lose value without telling investors. Goldman employees themselves use profanity to disparage the deals.

[00:21:27]
Boy, that Timberwolf was one deal.

[00:21:31]
And when asked if any of the executives at least felt partly responsible for the financial collapse, there's things that we wish we could have done better in hindsight or even regret.

[00:21:41]
Regret, to me means something that you feel like you did wrong. And I don't have that.

[00:21:47]
When you hear your own employees or read about those in the emails, do you feel anything? I feel I think that's very unfortunate to have on e-mail. Are you and and very unfortunate. I don't get emails and please don't take that feeling that way. I think it's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that.

[00:22:05]
God damn, even the crowd, do you see them? Even the crowd in the chamber was like, oh, you know how bad you have to screw things up to turn a Senate hearing into a Jerry Springer taping. But this is how you know, how psychotic these guys are. Not only did they tank the economy, but they talk about emotions like they're serial killers. Do you regret hurting these people? Regret is a thing that one feels when one has done something wrong.

[00:22:32]
I mean, how can you expect these guys to change their behavior when they can't even express their remorse the closest? Wall Street comes to reflecting is doing Coke off of a mirror. So after all the damage Wall Street has done to people's lives, please miss me with all of this whining about how unfair it is for Redit to boost GameStop. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all these guys are heroes, but I will say it has been fun watching how some of the people who got rich off of GameStop have been spending their money.

[00:23:02]
While GameStop has mentored plenty of millionaires, many retail investors are using their more modest profits to pay bills.

[00:23:09]
One Reddit user even posting that he paid off his student loan debt thanks to the money he's made off of GameStop the last few days.

[00:23:15]
Ten year old Jaden Carr. Two years ago, his mom bought him 10 shares of GameStop as a Kwanzaa gift. Back then, they were six dollars each. Now he sold them for more than three thousand dollars. What are you going to do with the money that you've made on GameStop?

[00:23:31]
I am already saying the rest.

[00:23:35]
The the of the company Hunter Con cashed in on the GameStop phenomenon last week, but didn't just cash in for himself. He used some of the money he made to donate six Nintendo switches and games to the children's hospital in Minnesota.

[00:23:50]
One day trader who cashed in on the craze walked into a GameStop store this week and started handing out hundred dollar bills to employees.

[00:23:58]
After the Robinhood app halted trading on GameStop, one investor chartered a plane to fly a banner over the company's headquarters saying, Suck my nuts, Robinhood.

[00:24:08]
Oh, that's a gangsta move right there. It's like Twitter, but in the sky now, you could say it's childish to spend money you took from Wall Street to dunk on Wall Street. And that may be. But in the words of Jim Cramer, it's legal and very satisfying. All right. When we come back, Ibrahim Candy will talk about African-American history that you might have missed. Hey, all with that, it's just hilarious and I'm just making sure y'all know that I got a book, it's called Carefully Reckless on the Black Effect Network.

[00:24:38]
I'm going to be telling you all my business and some of your other people's business, too. And ain't no limits to the things that talk about, you know, that if y'all know me from baby mama drama to healthy relationships, from child support to stimulus checks, look, will you take a step back and you realize that we all go through crazy stuff and we got stories to tell. Those situations do not define you, but they do make for real good conversation in the world with click bait and cancel calls.

[00:25:01]
You can tell your story before you do. I'm creating the outlet to remind people that we still human crazy and we can all laugh about it. Don't stress over it. Bring your problems to me. I promise I won't judge you. But am I crack a joke to you?

[00:25:12]
Don't be scared. It'll be respectful and messy at the same time. Just make sure you tune in. Listen to Carefully Reckless every Wednesday on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast.

[00:25:27]
Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Professor Ibrahim Scandi. He's a historian who you might know from his award winning book, How to Be an Anti-racist. We talked about his new anthology of African-American history and so much more. Professor Kennedy, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:25:48]
It's great to be back on the show. Yeah, it's good to be back for you. But technically, the last time I saw you was in the studio and a lot has changed since then. I mean, not just the fact that people at home, but the fact that America has seen so many changes.

[00:26:03]
And yet some may argue America has seen so much more of the same. Your book goes to The New York Times best sellers list during the protests. And what many people gravitated to in your work was how you laid steps out for people to engage in anti-racism. Tell me a little bit more about that and firstly, why you felt it was necessary to lay out the steps and the tools that people could use and why it's so important to be anti-racist as opposed to just not being racist when racial inequity and injustice is normal.

[00:26:36]
If you do nothing, what's going to happen to that normality? It's going to persist. And so I really wanted to encourage people to actively challenge racism, but also to to realize there's a direct opposite to notions of racial hierarchy, and that's notions of racial equality, which are anti-racist ideas. There's a direct opposite to policies that lead to maintain racial inequity, and that's anti-racist policy. So so we can be creating a different type of America with different types of policies and different type of ideas.

[00:27:10]
A lot of people love your work because you delve into the past and you tie it to the present. This project is really special.

[00:27:16]
Because you are editing a book about the history of being African-American. And yet, instead of just looking at it through the lens of one person, one author, one story teller, you've gone with multiple stories, just everyone from every walk of life who fought for black freedom in America, from the slave trade all the way through to the current day. Tell me why you thought you could really tell a story that has been told so many times in a different way.

[00:27:45]
Why do you think I'll jump on this project to edit this book?

[00:27:49]
Well, I mean, with the four hundredth anniversary or birthday of a black America approaching. I think we wanted to figure out a new way to tell. Black, black, America's history, we wanted a new way to commemorate this moment, and one of the oldest racist ideas is this idea that we're a monolith, that that there is not incredible diversity within black America. And also African-American history has traditionally been written by a man, oftentimes a black man.

[00:28:27]
And so I think with those two things, we really wanted to bring together a community to write the history of a community, an extremely diverse community. And I think that's one of the things we're most proud about in terms of this book, just the diversity of blackness within the book and even the ordinary and extraordinary characters we share.

[00:28:48]
When you look at those stories, do you ever wonder what your dream is for the end goal? Sometimes I'll be talking to friends who will say, what is your definition of white privilege? And I say, just for me personally, I go for me, white privilege is you have the opportunity to fail on your behalf and succeed on your behalf and your behalf alone. Know if a white man launches a rocket to the moon. That's what he did know.

[00:29:12]
If a white man shoots up a school, that's what he did. If a black person launches a rocket to the moon, then I mean, these niggas be launching rockets, you know what I'm saying? And so I wonder what your idea is. As a professor who studies race, what do you what are you hoping that we get to? What place do you hope to see us achieve? Well, it's it's ironic you speak about that individuality, because I think in the introduction to 400 Souls, I wrote about how we're not able as black people to be individuals.

[00:29:43]
Right. And so certainly for me, that would be an end goal. But I also think, you know, justice you know, equal justice for all peoples. You know, just something as simple as when I see a member of public safety or a police officer or whatever we would have in the future. I don't feel scared, you know, when I haven't done anything wrong. I'm not going to to to certainly feel scared or something. Like I walk into a place to to apply for a job.

[00:30:19]
And I don't have to look twice at what I'm wearing and how I'm going to speak, because that's not really going to matter, especially if, you know, I have the qualifications.

[00:30:30]
I've always wondered, you know, when I traveled the world, I was you know, I've been lucky enough. My comedy would take me to different countries. I was always intrigued by how black people specifically would be treated differently when they were not the black of that country. You know, like black Americans would come to South Africa and oftentimes it was shopkeepers or just people in the street. They'd be like, oh, you're a black American. Very, very different.

[00:30:58]
And sometimes even Africans from other African countries would come and be treated differently. The same, I would notice, in America. Is that something in the story of race that is also tied to the history of how the country has treated the people of that race in the country?

[00:31:14]
I think so. I think race and racism is simultaneously global and national. In other words, you can see similar trends across the world.

[00:31:26]
But each of those trends, each of those policies and each of those racial constructions are distinct to the nation. But what's also consistent is pretty much every nation in the world argues that they're not racist towards.

[00:31:44]
Yeah, you see that across the board, whether it's the South African apartheid government or through to the US, no matter who it is, people go like, no, no, no, no, we're not racist. We just do these racist things to these people. There's there's a new administration in the White House. Many people feel like this is a new opportunity for America. Joe Biden has said on multiple occasions that racism is going to be at the forefront of his agenda, which has drawn him a lot of criticism.

[00:32:11]
What would you hope that he would do actually do that could move America forward in achieving that racial equality? Well, one thing he's doing with the coronavirus is he's he continues to say that he's going to put science before politics. And so as it relates to racial inequity and injustice, if he was to put silence science before politics, if he was to essentially look at what scholars are saying, how we can eliminate inequities and injustices, how we can reduce or eliminate police, not necessarily be as concerned about white swing voters or even Republican voters, that I think he would be able to make some serious advances in rooting out racism.

[00:32:57]
But the fact of the matter is, is the irony is the very folks who support racist policies that drive us apart through inequities, who support racist policies, that maintain racial injustice, that causes people to be killed by police, which then leads to mass demonstrations, are the very people trying to claim we're divisive. Right. And that's the that's the that's the fundamental fallacy. We want to equality brings people together last night.

[00:33:28]
Well, I will say this. It will always be a journey. It will always be a challenging one. But having somebody like you and people like you who are writing some of the most amazing works to help us figure it all out, I think helps every single day. So thank you so much for joining us on the show again. Thank you for editing this amazing piece of work. And I hope to see you again.
