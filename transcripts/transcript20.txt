Hey, what's going on, everybody? I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is February 9th, which means you only have five days left to prepare for Valentine's Day. And let's be honest, after the year we've all been through. Remember to focus on what's really important this year. Don't worry about spending a lot of money on champagne or jewelry. All you need to give your loved one is to stolen vials of the FISA vaccine.

[00:01:35]
Anyway, on tonight's show, why India is beefing with Rihanna to say Sloan weighs in on Gorilla Glue and Donald Trump is on trial for murdering the Constitution. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:48]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with criminal lawyers.

[00:02:03]
Let's kick things off with today's big story. Donald J. Trump, unemployed Twitter board and former president of the United States.

[00:02:13]
Today, Trump became the only president ever to face a second impeachment trial, which is pretty impressive when you consider he only showed up to work about half of the time. I mean, if Trump really applied himself as president, we could be on impeachment number thirty five by now. And the trial kicked off today with Democrats presenting a video which showed Trump's speech on January 6th, interspersed with scenes of violence from his supporters.

[00:02:40]
We're going to walk down and I'll be there with you. We're going to walk down. We're going to walk down to the Capitol. We are going to the capital where problems are. Wow, what a powerful video that Republican senators didn't see because they pretended to go to the bathroom. But you can definitely tell that this impeachment is the sequel because the sequel always has to turn things up to 11. The original impeachment was like, listen to this diplomat.

[00:03:28]
Describe a phone call as you ponder the meaning of quid pro quo.

[00:03:34]
But this impeachment is like Michael Bay presents from impeachment. You we're slamming the Capitol.

[00:03:44]
But after the video, it was the Trump defense team's turn to make the best possible case. Although based on how it went today, I'm worried that Trump is going to get the chair. My name is Bruce Castor.

[00:03:57]
I am the lead prosecutor, lead counsel for the forty fifth person in the United States. I was assistant D.A. for such a long time. I keep saying prosecutor, but I do understand the difference. I don't want to steal the thunder from the other lawyers. But Nebraska, you're going to hear, is quite a judicial thinking place.

[00:04:20]
My parents had on a record and we still know what records are right on the thing you put the needle down on and the play it.

[00:04:31]
And the other day when I was down here in Washington, I came down earlier in the week to try to figure out how to find my way around.

[00:04:42]
I worked in this building 40 years ago.

[00:04:44]
I got lost then and I still do.

[00:04:47]
The founders recognized that the the argument that I started with that he talks about Gallant Men was the name of the of the of the album.

[00:05:06]
Good Lord. Trump's lawyers giving the speech you give when you have to stall because the actual lawyer stuck in traffic, Trump is probably watching this at home, like, what the hell is wrong with this guy? The ad on the side of the bus said that he was the best. Why would he be on a bus if he's not the best? Although I will say this, the fact that Trump now has a lawyer who's not leaking Princetonian out of his head, that's a step in the right direction.

[00:05:29]
Here's the crazy thing. It doesn't actually matter what this guy says. He could get up there and trim his pubes for hours because the jury has already reached its verdict.

[00:05:41]
In just the last hour, the Senate voted that the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump can move forward. Six Republicans joined with Democrats in a fifty six to forty four vote, saying the impeachment trial is constitutional.

[00:05:54]
The question, though, is would there in any scenario be enough Republicans to cross the aisle to vote to convict the former president, Donald Trump? And given that just six across the aisle here on this vote today and they'll need 17 to do that in order to convict him, it doesn't look like the impeachment managers are going to be able to get there.

[00:06:13]
That's right. People, before this trial even started, almost every Republican juror has made it clear that they don't want a trial at all. And I get it. I get why Republicans voted this way, because on the one hand, yes, an angry mob stormed the Capitol building where they work and could have killed them. Yes.

[00:06:32]
But on the other hand, everyone hates jury duty, although honestly, I don't know why some of these sentences are even allowed to be on the jury. It was my understanding that same crazy shit like I want to overthrow the government was how you got out of jury duty. And I know that this vote might make the trial seem pointless now. Yes. But just because we know how the trial will end doesn't mean the trial shouldn't take place. I mean, when you're watching Law and Order, right, you turn it off in the first five minutes when the cops interview a dentist who obviously killed his patient to cover up an affair.

[00:07:02]
Of course not. You watch the whole thing because then you get to say, I knew it. When you end up being right now, we're going to keep you up to date on the impeachment right up until the moment that Trump is acquitted. But for now, let's move on from President Trump to someone else dealing with a never ending bad hair day.

[00:07:19]
Gorilla Glue is now responding after a woman use their product and her hair. Tezuka Brown posted on Instagram earlier this month that her hair had been stuck in the same style for over a month after she used gorilla glue spray to keep her hair in place. Brown says she used the gorilla glue after she ran out of her usual spray. Brown had to actually go to the hospital for medical help in removing the glue she's taken to social media with her plans of hiring an attorney to pursue charges against gorilla glue.

[00:07:50]
She claims while the product's label warns against using on the skin or clothing, it does not mention hair.

[00:07:58]
Man, you've got to feel bad for this woman because as crazy as this is, I kind of know how she feels, right? One time I accidentally ordered Papa John's Pizza thinking it was food no one was. Now, obviously, I have my own thoughts on this story, but you get a more relevant perspective, I want to bring in our very own resident experts, say Sloane, to see what's going on.

[00:08:22]
I thought I would give you a call.

[00:08:24]
Well, well, well, huh, I. You would be calling me when there's a black woman in the news.

[00:08:33]
No, no, no. Don't say. Come on. It's not like that. Oh, so you want to talk about Elon Musk and you know, you want to talk about Tesla buying up Bitcoin?

[00:08:42]
Oh, yeah. Yeah. But for now, I wanted to talk about the Gorilla Glue Girl.

[00:08:49]
That's what I thought. Look, Trevor, just because a black woman does something doesn't mean you have to talk to me, OK? You could have talked to Ronnie, you could have talked to Costa. I mean, he thinks black lives matter. You know, I don't want to talk about this as a black woman.

[00:09:04]
You know what to say. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't even think of. I apologize. We can just we can just end this.

[00:09:11]
But I do want to talk about this as a crafter because I'm a crafter. Trevor, you know, I'm sitting here making Valentine's Day cards for my friends. And I got all the he here, OK? I got double sided tape. I got a hot glue gun. I got to tape. We hold and stuff down over here.

[00:09:29]
Trevor OK, so then what do you make of the story as a crofter, as the character?

[00:09:36]
This story makes me want to buy gorilla glue. I mean, if that glue and lock her hair in place for a month, maybe could have kept me and my ex together, literally joined at the hip. I mean, it would have made sex difficult, but, you know, we'll work it out. Where is he going?

[00:09:49]
You know, it's actually funny you say that because Gorilla Glue actually had to issue a statement defending themselves. They basically said that you can't blame them because the bottle says you can't put it on skin.

[00:10:01]
Yeah, but in her defense, they didn't say you can't put it on scalp. And also the bottle says all the stuff. You can put it on fabric, good plastic. She wants to read all of that and been like, well, if this can put wood down my edge, is that going to be immaculate?

[00:10:16]
So you sympathize with Jessica Brown?

[00:10:19]
Of course I do, Trevor. No one wants to see someone go through some shit like this. Black women, we want our edges to be laid, but not forever. And you should see the comments. A lot of people are trying to help her out. We're like Tetsuko trash, coconut oil, triacetone trash. Jesus. Yeah.

[00:10:38]
Say now, you know, someone is in trouble when even the online commenters are like, no, we need help. This person. That's how serious this God. The only question is like, how do you think this whole thing is going to end?

[00:10:49]
I think this is going to work out for her. I mean, at some point her hair is going to get fixed. And in the meantime, she's lucky she was going for a ponytail when this all happened. I mean, imagine she was trying to do some new shit, ended up with a Mohawk this whole time. Oh, like my Uncle Josh, he got an awful haircut this one time. Let me show you. You know, Trevor, I got to go, I got I got to go, I got to go.

[00:11:17]
Is everything OK? Is everything OK?

[00:11:19]
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. You know, it's my prayer time. I'll just.

[00:11:25]
You are you structure. Did you put your glue gun on your chair?

[00:11:29]
No, man, I'm trying to give you a nice little eggs, I'm trying to give you all the razzle dazzle, you know, kind of like a sleep out. See, that's not about you.

[00:11:37]
Where it goes. If you glued if you glued to your chair, you should call. You should call someone to say that this is the basketball somewhere. Don't worry about me.

[00:11:45]
Or will you let me know if you need help. Don't say to say Sloan, everybody. All right. Let's move on now to our main story. And it comes out of India, the country that Christopher Columbus is dumb ass couldn't find. And we're talking about India because in a year of global protests, they're in the midst of the biggest one anywhere.

[00:12:05]
Thousands of farmers blocked highways across India today in protest of the country's new agricultural laws. The blockades are only the latest development in the face off between agricultural workers and the government.

[00:12:16]
This is one of the busiest highways leading to Delhi. It's been blocked for weeks. Tens of thousands of farmers from the northern states of India have marched to the capital city.

[00:12:27]
Last November, they organized a national strike involving two hundred and fifty million people. That's more than all the adults in America. Their struggle isn't going unnoticed.

[00:12:38]
Orombi megastar Rihanna asked her one hundred million Twitter followers, why aren't we talking about this? Climate activist Gretta to Berg tweeted a message of solidarity, sparking a serious response from the Indian government.

[00:12:51]
It's also drawn the ire of New Delhi police, who in only the last few hours have now filed the police case. Citing Sternberg's tweets.

[00:12:59]
Rianna and gratitude book effigies were burnt recently by pro-government crowds after they tweeted in favor of the farmer's dam.

[00:13:09]
When a country that hot starts burning shit, you know they aren't messing around. I mean, they're burning Gretta Tuborg in effigy, which is really going to piss her off. I mean, think of all the carbon emissions, by the way. There was definitely at least one guy in the crowd who already had a life sized around a pillow.

[00:13:28]
He was at the protest like, no, guys, it's an effigy. Let's burn it. I definitely didn't marry this below. So why exactly are India's farmers protesting?

[00:13:40]
Well, let's step back and find out in another installment of If You Don't Know Now you know.

[00:13:54]
When you think about farming, what do you think about? You probably think about how it works in the United States. Giant agribusiness companies running giant farms where they raise cows that are so jacked on steroids, they look like when you milk them, protein shakes come out of their teeth. But most Indian farmers work on a much smaller scale. And it's when the government tried to change that up that the manure hit the fan.

[00:14:17]
This is all happening because Prime Minister Modi's government has passed new farming laws that will change how the agricultural industry has worked for decades.

[00:14:27]
India's agriculture sector makes up nearly 15 percent of the country's two point nine trillion dollar economy and employs around half of its one point three billion people.

[00:14:37]
The vast majority of India's farmers own fewer than three acres.

[00:14:41]
For decades, they've sold their produce in their home states government sanctioned markets called Mon's, a system that guaranteed minimum prices on several key commodities.

[00:14:52]
In September last year, the government passed three farm laws that loosened rules on how crops are produced, stored and sold. The laws allow private players a greater role, and that sparked farmers fears that they will lose decades old concessions and be left to fend for themselves at the mercy of the free market. The measures, they say, will only benefit big corporations and push them into poverty.

[00:15:19]
These laws will have an effect on anyone who eats. People buy from us at very low prices and we lose our livelihoods.

[00:15:26]
Man, that sounds like a really rough situation for those farmers. And if this last year has taught us anything, it's that we cannot take farmers for granted. No way in the world we need farmers. I mean, we all saw what happened when we tried to grow our own vegetables on our kitchen window sills. After nine months, what did we grow? Nothing other than resentment and hatred for our roommates. And this law is going to have widespread repercussions because farming employs 600 million people in India.

[00:15:56]
That's almost twice the entire population of the United States, which, apart from everything else, is just another reminder that the Twitter trends are pretty bullshit. I mean, you'd think the entire world is talking about the Joker in the Snyder cut when in reality, if everyone was on Twitter, the top trending topics every day would just be weeks. So with their livelihoods at stake, India's farmers decided to make their opposition known by blocking the roads into the capital as a form of civil disobedience.

[00:16:25]
You know, it's like that Mahatma Gandhi quote I saw on the Internet, sitting in traffic sucks major ass.

[00:16:32]
And that's how things stayed for a while until a couple of weeks ago when they escalated it big time.

[00:16:37]
The largely peaceful campaign briefly turned violent last week when protesters drove a procession of tractors into the heart of the capital, New Delhi. Some farmers confronted police who fired back with tear gas. The government has arrested more than 120 people and charged farm union leaders with rioting and sedition.

[00:16:56]
Now the government's responding by using massive concrete barriers to box in the three main sit in sites along New Delhi's highways. It's also cut off electricity, water and the Internet.

[00:17:07]
Delhi police have deployed fifty thousand police and paramilitary personnel in and around the capital. There were extra drones flying over protest sites. They have erected thousands of iron nails on some of the roads leading up to some of the sites.

[00:17:22]
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has broke his silence, describing violence in the capital, New Delhi, last Tuesday as an insult to the country. Modi says he will not change his mind on the new laws, but has repeated an offer to delay them for 18 months.

[00:17:35]
Hot damn that tractor was moving. It's like someone made a Grand Theft Auto mission in Animal Crossing. But look, clearly the government has decided that they've had enough of this protest because this is a major crackdown and maybe they think postponing the law will satisfy the farmer. But think about it, in 18 months, people will be in the same position that they are in now and the protests will happen all over again. I mean, you're basically just giving people 18 months to get angrier and soup up their tractors even more.

[00:18:05]
But you see, this crackdown shows you how worried the government must be about this protest. And honestly, they probably should be because it's clear that these farmers are digging in for the long haul.

[00:18:16]
Farmers say they're undeterred by the government's crackdown and will continue their protests until the agriculture laws are repealed.

[00:18:24]
Tens of lined the highway where farmers spend cold winter nights. Water tankers are brought in by tractors for bathing, cooking and cleaning. Medical boards have been set up to tend to the sick. Dozens of people, young and old, are busy cooking in community kitchens and serving meals is a makeshift mall, a roadside market selling jackets and coats.

[00:18:45]
Youngsters intermittently break the routine with song and dance atop tractors.

[00:18:50]
We've made this our home, whether it takes four years or. We're here to stay. Now, you see there, that's some determination right there, that dude is ready to protest for four years, which doesn't surprise me because nobody on earth is more patient than a farmer. Farmers of the same people who will wait five months to grow an eggplant and eggplant. I'm not even patient enough to find it in the Mojie. Sometimes I'll just send like a cucumber or something.

[00:19:19]
And, you know, if you ask me, it was especially smart of those farmers to build a mole inside their camp because think about it now. If the government sends in police officers, those cops automatically become more cops and lose all authority. Check, mate. So the next time you see Indian farmers trending, you'll have a little idea of what it all means. The government is trying to force the farmers back to their fields, but the farmers aren't giving up their demands and nobody knows how this thing is going to end up.

[00:19:53]
But I don't know if I may quote one of their prominent supporters. This protest might just work, work, work, work, work, work in this mountain. Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, bird. And if you don't know now you know. All right. When we come back, Robin Roberts is joining us on the show. And Noah Centineo is also going to be here. So stick around.

[00:20:15]
If you're like me and spend hours on Instagram scrolling past all the over filtered, perfect highlight reels of other women and just wish you had someone to commiserate with about your nightly shame spiral. I have great news for you. I'm Jay David and I'm the host of Tell Me About It. The weekly podcast is here to remind you that the women we constantly compare ourselves to, yes, even that one also have lives that are far from perfect, whether it's admitting all the times you've texted your ex navigating the world of fertility treatments or feeling like the only one in the room with depression, nothing quite compares to the relief you feel when another woman admits they've said exactly where you are and lived to tell the tale.

[00:20:56]
So cancel that zoom happy hour. You know, you didn't want to go anyway and come hang with me as I talk to women, I respect about all the insecurities, mistakes and the heartbreaks that they don't normally post about on Instagram. Join me for a heart to Hearts with Tecmo, Bosma, Saint John, environmentalist and influencer, Steph Shapp, actress Jamie Lynn Sigler and many more. Listen to tell me about it with Jada on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.

[00:21:24]
Hey guys. Been both here and I'm the creator of a crazy little show called BLAW Concern for Comedy Central Digital.

[00:21:29]
And I'm Krista Freeman's boss, the voice of Clarkson, whose name is Well, Son, we made this insane show at the studio that makes robot chicken.

[00:21:35]
Markinson is a mixed media puppet show that follows an overly manly father named Blac, who desperately tries to connect with his overly nerdy son.

[00:21:42]
He got some really cool people involved. Justin Rowland, Donald Faison, Jane Lynch, Jim Rash, Debra Baker, Jr.. It's a really fun show that we're really proud of, and it's available right now on Comedy Central's YouTube channel. So go check it out. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Good Morning America's very own Robin Roberts. We talked about her new special about the Tuskegee Airmen returning to the studio after broadcasting from home and who the greatest NFL players of all time.

[00:22:13]
Robin Roberts, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:22:18]
It's it's it's a pleasure to be here.

[00:22:21]
Many people know you as the face of Good Morning America. You have been the face of America's institution for an extremely long time. But a lot of people may not know that you were the face of Sports Center for 15 years and you covered the NFL for an extremely long time. So I would like to know from you the most important question that is plaguing America right now. Is Tom Brady the greatest of all time? All.

[00:22:43]
Oh, come on. Give me something hard. That's a softball. You start with me. That's a softball. I he's the goat. OK, ok. No, no, no. Fine.

[00:22:52]
I'll give you a hug one. Robert, is Tom Brady the greatest athlete of all time? See that that's OK. That's harder. Is he the greatest athlete of all time? You know what? That's debatable. I love me some Serena Williams. Twenty three Grand Slam titles won when she was pregnant. Try that, Tom Brady.

[00:23:14]
OK, you win. You win a Super Bowl while pregnant. Maybe maybe we'll talk, you know, but it's fun to have this argument. And I'm just glad to in my lifetime to have seen to be seeing someone like that too high. Michael Jordan, to be seeing Serena Williams. I mean, we've had some great, great athletes during our time, but he is he is special.

[00:23:39]
You've always shown love to the team that you work with on camera. Every single morning we wake up with you. We enjoy watching you. What has it been like doing the show from home now? Because a lot of your show is about that chemistry that you share in person.

[00:23:53]
It really is. And I got to tell you, I've got some great teammates at GMA, Michael Strahan, who's at home now because he was diagnosed with covid-19. Yeah, fine, thank goodness. But now he's broadcasting from home for time. George had to do the same. I did it for the longest. I was at home seven months. And my PA duesler, my Darlow, my girlfriend, Amber, helping out. That was really difficult.

[00:24:18]
It was really challenging to keep that that chemistry when you have like a two second delay, you know. But more than that, it's just. But I have to say, Trevor, what I came back into the studio in September, man, it is like I can't describe the feeling. And I know it's a feeling that a lot of people are going to have once they can get back to their workplace. We've never been better. We've never been more in sync.

[00:24:43]
You've been the face that has guided America through crises. You've been there to share some of the most fun stories. But this new project that you're embarking on might be my favorite Robin Roberts project. Yet it's about the Tuskegee Airmen and it's entitled Legacy of Courage. And what I love about it is not that you're telling the story, but your connection to the story. Tell me how this all came to be, please.

[00:25:05]
Their legacy is so broad, fighting fascism abroad and then racism back here at home. My father, Colonel Lawrence Roberts, was a Tuskegee airman at the age of 19. He got on a segregated train train to be a pilot. What they did in World War Two, what the Tuskegee Airmen, a.k.a. the Red Tails, because they had to pay their tails so they would know because they escorted bombers and they need to know that they were friendlies that was escorting them like that Exupery flying record that they had and that they had to fight for that.

[00:25:40]
Right. Thank Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a first lady at the time with down the Tuskegee. Can you imagine this went down to Tuskegee in the 40s, got in a plane with a black man, flew with them and said, all right, let them go. And so then they were able to go and actually be in combat before they could just train, but they couldn't fight. And now they want to do was fight for their country like everybody else at that time.

[00:26:04]
I've often seen I've often seen the story of of the Tuskegee Airmen as as myth. It's African-American myth and it's beautiful. It's like these legends and these heroes. But this story takes us through a different journey about how they were fighting just to get the military to accept black service members, just to get the American public to accept black service members. It was a challenge that we really take for granted when you just seeing the accolades that they achieved now.

[00:26:29]
And that's why it's so important that people watch this film, because we take you there. All they wanted to do was fight for this country. They wanted to fly. And when they came back from the war, it wasn't as heroes. They came back and after all they had done, they were told back of the bus, you're second class citizen. And they fought to.

[00:26:52]
Integrate the military and also many of them became very, very much a part of the civil rights movement at the time. Really gave us as as as as the public a framework to go like, oh, my gosh, you know, they were challenged that they didn't have the intellect to fly. But you know what? They showed that excellence and, yes, black excellence can beat adversity of all types. And that's the kind of message that they said, too, to so many people back here in the US.

[00:27:24]
There's no denying that in America there is the dichotomy that many black people face when they say, I love this country, and yet it feels like this country does not love me in return. From your father's perspective and being his daughter and seeing how he navigated this paradox, what do you think we can learn from that journey and how to, I think, have the conversations in and around patriotism and still challenging America to be better to its citizens?

[00:27:48]
Thank you for using the word patriotism. My father was a patriot, a true patriot, and that's all he ever said, he would talk about how he felt freer in the air than on the land as a black man in this country. And I think it's very timely, given what we went through in twenty twenty. The racial reckoning, seeing all black, white, taking to the streets and saying, no more, no more. It was really and I think this is why this film is so timely, because, yes, we go back and we show their legacy, but we also bring it to today.

[00:28:23]
You see how they impacted the Barack Obama himself said they were an example to him that propelled him into public service. So I think when we watch a film like this, we're reminded of our history and it lets us know why am I taking to the streets? And yes, some things we're still fighting for something similar that we're fighting for that they did as well. It's heartfelt.

[00:28:46]
It's wonderful. And I can see why, because of the story and the and the history that you share with one of those airmen and I guess the story of all of them combined. Robin Roberts, thank you so much for joining me on the show.

[00:28:56]
Next time I'm going to wear a hoodie, going to bring it back on the show. I'm going to be OK. Don't do that to America, Robin. You do that to America. I beg you, do not do that to America.

[00:29:05]

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Noah Centineo, star of the hit Netflix franchise to all the boys. We talked about his journey from playing romantic hero to superhero and so much more. Noah Centineo, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:30:12]
Glad to be here. Very. I mean, is this even social distancing of where I even in the same room, this is like telemetric distancing. It's not.

[00:30:21]
I think it's the ultimate form of social. This is the furthest distance that you can do socially to be.

[00:30:26]
Yeah, it's like a social distancing.

[00:30:29]
I like that's that's exactly what is this like a Noah thing or just Noah's growing their hair. Is that what's going on right now.

[00:30:34]
I suppose I suppose if you pull your eyes it's probably. Oh yeah.

[00:30:39]
Mine can go. Yeah, yeah. It can go all the way. I try and keep it like just you know, it depends on the day. I just, I just, you know, it's, I get it. It's this is a feeling.

[00:30:51]
Yeah. Yeah it is a feeling. But welcome to the show. I wanted to have you on for a while, not for anything professional just because I'm a fan. You know, I, I grew up watching rom coms like there was like a period in my life when rom coms with the best possible movie that you could watch, like in the cinema or at home, and then all of a sudden rom coms weren't cool.

[00:31:12]
And then I had to act like I didn't like them. And then to all the boys came along and then yourself and Lana, just you took me back to a time that I that I forgot. I enjoy it as much as I did. Laura Jean and Peter Kravinsky have this magic on camera, but I feel like yourself in line to have it off camera as well. You have this vibe about you as people. It's like, you know, because we live in an age now where back in the day movie stars were movie stars and that was it.

[00:31:37]
You see them otherwise. Whereas with with with movie stars of today we get to touch you and feel you on social media. We get to see who you are when there's no movie taking place. When you look at your life and how it's changed, what do you think is the reason that people are so into you as an actor and as a person right now? Like there's something that people are clearly gravitating towards me.

[00:31:58]
It's I mean, it's a good question. I was talking about this literally like two days ago about the difference between being like in movies fifty years ago versus now is this there's practically no barrier because of social media. I don't know.

[00:32:14]
I feel like I'm fairly eccentric and fairly quirky and fairly goofy in my own right. And I think because I kind of lean into social media without necessarily making it like a cash cow for myself.

[00:32:31]
Right, right. Right. Yeah. Doing shoots so that I look a certain way. Like I kind of just have utilized social media as a tool to be like, this is who I am and what I'm doing today. I think I think that combined with doing a project and playing a role like Peter Kavinsky, that I guess was relatable or hit a certain way, just kind of made for this storm where people went, oh, yeah, I want to continue to see whatever this person's doing.

[00:32:56]
Is there a part of you that that is already sad at the fact that you will never get to be Peter Kavinsky again? I mean, I guess maybe you guys will do like an old age home version of it, but for now, it's done.

[00:33:05]
If we do it for Mark Ruffalo to play older Peter, I can actually see it.

[00:33:11]
You know, I can actually see it makes a strong return. Reigning champion of rom coms that is sweet is like, I guess the most generic way, but accurate way to describe it. Right? Sad. No, I don't feel sadness about it. I feel I feel like it's resolved. As far as the way that trilogy's series get to resolve, I think that, you know, I feel very good about the resolution. You know, I feel like I've given as much as I possibly can to Peter.

[00:33:42]
And so I haven't I don't really have any regrets. I think the thing I care about the most is that the fans, the people that not just follow me but, you know, love the world so much, I hope that they feel fulfillment out of the third movie.

[00:33:57]
Dude, if people are fans of yours, they they are not going to suffer. Struggling to find places to watch, you have become one of the most in demand actors in Hollywood. You're going to be starring in the diary directed by Jackie Chan. Right. You're going to be starring alongside Dwayne the Rock Johnson in Black Adam. And then just I think like a few days ago, I saw, like, online, they were like, yeah, no one is going to be in the movie about the GameStop shares, things that happened.

[00:34:26]
I was like, how is that even a movie? What does that even. Ah, you like buying the shares. Are you selling the shares? Are you are you Robin Hood, are you GameStop? We wonder what is happening here.

[00:34:34]
My buddy Enzo is super in tune with that whole situation right about it like like three weeks ago.

[00:34:42]
And so I immediately was like, well I'm like I'm buying into these. Like I'll buy, I'll watch it. We're watching it. And my manager comes over one day. He's like, what are you guys talking about? And so we were like, we just like like we're talking incessantly about it. And the next thing I know, boom, there's a whole project.

[00:35:04]
I'll tell you, as a fan of yours, it's been insane watching the journey continue growing, continue having fun. Don't stop being grateful. Thank you for joining me on the show. My dude. Dude.

[00:35:12]
No, of course. Thank you. I don't want to say goodbye that there's got to be more. There's always more. There's always more. But there's time limits on everything. There's time limits on everything. And I just hope the audience watches this interview and goes, you know what? This gave me the conclusion I was looking for this gave me the ending.

[00:35:30]
I was like, I'm not even going to watch the movie. This was all.

[00:35:33]
And, you know, thanks for joining me, man.

[00:35:36]
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for having me. And good to see you again. Take care, brother. I'll see. Don't forget to all the boys, always and forever will stream on Netflix on February 12th.
