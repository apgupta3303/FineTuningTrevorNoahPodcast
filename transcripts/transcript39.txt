[00:00:45]
Last week, we saw one of the darkest days in American history, and for better or worse, it was there. It was a day that began with the president holding a rally outside of the White House to push lies about voter fraud and urged his followers to take action to overturn the election.

[00:01:02]
Excuse me, is this sedition happening over here? Is a sedition is it over here? Do you know where the edition is?

[00:01:14]
I still say we do not consent to be governed, nor shall we ever be consented to be governed by an illegal, fraudulent election.

[00:01:25]
But you elected a guy who also doesn't care much about consent. We do not consent. Will you accept Joe Biden as the United States on the 20th? No, I will not accept it. No, I will not. Look what I. I've educated myself about this. I don't know all what's in the Constitution. Have you read it? It's pretty short Constitution of America. Yeah. I've not read the whole thing. No, you've read the entire thing.

[00:01:43]
Yes. It's remarkably short. All right. I doubt that. But it's OK. You should read it because you might be committing a seditious act in an hour and a half.

[00:01:49]
OK, I'm not going to comment about that. If people didn't vote for Joe Biden.

[00:01:52]
No, the Dominion system voted for Joe Biden. Do you think it's possible that Hugo Chavez infiltrated the Dominion systems, change the votes orchestrated by Joe? Anything's possible. Do you think it's possible that a president who never polled above 50 percent lost the election, saw about it? Absolutely not. That's not possible.

[00:02:13]
The one thing you couldn't help but notice was just how many people looked like they were preparing for battle. From the tactical vest to the pitchforks, this rally felt charged.

[00:02:23]
You can tell these people really love America by the number of weapons they brought to hurt other Americans. It looks like we got some probable action, either that or the Kabbalist Street team. Would your flag that come and take it home and take it? Do you have a weapon? No, no. Why not? Do they take it? Sorry, bro. I was worried that we were in trouble. But then I saw that we got the tyranny response team here and I feel a lot better.

[00:02:55]
Thanks for all you do.

[00:02:57]
And for those supposedly caught off guard claiming they didn't see this violence coming. If you paid attention to any of these rallies, all you have to do is open your eyes and ears. The message isn't exactly subtle.

[00:03:10]
Make no mistake, we have the guns and we are now in the streets. We are going to clean this place out one way or another. You are down there. I have one million plus people.

[00:03:26]
Angry, very, very angry people. Can I ask why you're carrying a pitchfork? Well, Pitchfork is a just an iconic representation of how of what people over time have done in this country. It feels more like a weapon, to be quite honest. It's not farm equipment and it's legal in this in the city. Yeah. Are you farming today? It's an it's a representation. We're not asking for violence right now.

[00:03:49]
I got to tell you, from the movies I've seen, the hordes of people with pitchforks are usually the bad guys.

[00:03:54]
How close you think we are to 1860, sir? Hang on. Are we close? Hell, yeah, you are. That's the Civil War. Would you rather die on your knees then be free. Aren't you a little bit freaked out? About six hundred thousand Americans die. I see you're not wearing masks. Never mind.

[00:04:10]
This thing was a powder keg. All it took was someone to light the fuse like these human blowtorches.

[00:04:16]
Let's have trial by combat. Stand up and fight. Stand up and hold your representatives accountable. We've got to walk down to the Capitol because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength with those orders. The crowd of economically anxious insurrectionist advanced on the capital. And so we've been following this protest. We headed to the capital and the Trump supporters just broke through the gates and they're now heading into the Capitol. Right now. People are getting waved up towards the Capitol.

[00:04:58]
Take it back. I'm hearing people say, let's keep going. Who are you with? The American people. The American people. Are you military? Not answer or not. You're not you're not military. No. Why are you dressed like military? I'm not just clothes that camouflage it is. But you're in an urban environment. Isn't that sort of the antithetical to camouflage?

[00:05:17]
I don't think so. Are you looking to make an aggressive action right now? I'm not going to make a statement. What's your statement? The election was stolen. We want free and fair elections. And if we can't have in this country, we don't have anything. So what do you plan on doing first to see how it unfolds. You see how it unfolds. All right. Good luck with the PayPal tournament.

[00:05:42]
Can I ask you some questions? What's your plan? What's your plan for what?

[00:05:48]
What are you are you storming the Capitol? I just got off your chest. I'm sorry. This is is this the last stand saying, oh, this looks like the last day? Are you afraid if you run out of batteries for the last and you'll be thwarted? Oh, good luck. I hope you don't run into bumpy terrain or stairs. While Segway Stonewall Jackson is laughable on his child Scooter, the rioters brought real weapons and committed real atrocities to our democracy.

[00:06:19]
Our police and even our cameraman does not matter to me. I would say you talking Trump's fake tough guy military are literally throwing themselves on the ground to perpetuate victimhood.

[00:06:33]
The Trump presidency is going to come to an end. This this seems fitting a show of aggression and with a bunch of people screaming at a building without a working understanding of how democracy works. America, twenty, twenty one.

[00:06:50]
Thunder cannon, tear gas, let's not wait to find out in the end, the crowd didn't stop our democracy. Let's take heart in that this shit stay in rebellion failed, as did my dry January.
