You're listening to Comedy Central now. Hi, this is Bill Clinton. Please join me on my podcast. Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this for conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know? We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future. Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.

[00:00:35]
My name is Rita Kaye. I am Ellen Bernstein Brodsky. This is your grandmother. What's the matter with you?

[00:00:43]
Well, and it is a podcast about the relationship between grandmothers and grandchildren, as my mother would have said, TACA, who wouldn't have wanted a Jewish grandmother?

[00:00:53]
Sometimes she accidentally live streams. We're like, who's going to tell her?

[00:00:57]
I'm just hearing about this now. Let's you to call your grandmother on the, I hope, radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.

[00:01:14]
The stock markets, America's number one supplier of great depressions, as volatile as the stock market can be. This has been one of its wildest weeks yet craziest business story out there.

[00:01:27]
And Internet trading mob is driving GameStop shares higher, it appears, despite short sellers. Look at the stock. It's up more than six hundred eighty percent so far this year.

[00:01:36]
They realized that all of the institutional investors were hedging on GameStop. So they just bought a bunch of call options, bought a bunch of stock and created the a squeeze that you saw on Friday.

[00:01:46]
OK, OK. I don't know about you, but that explanation is way too complicated. Short selling the thing of the long selling and the look.

[00:01:56]
What we really need here is that scene from the Big Short where Margot Robbie breaks it down for us in the bathtub, you know, and I actually called her to do that, but she blocked my number. So I had to figure out plan B.

[00:02:12]
But basically there's a group of people on Reddit who don't use the stock market to invest. They use it to gamble. And yeah, that's what a lot of serious investors do to put these guys on Reddit a more honest about it. And they love to troll the people who aren't. So there's a store called GameStop that sells video games. Not a great business to be in. Such games can be downloaded now, which is why the serious investors decided to short GameStop, which means to bet against it.

[00:02:43]
But the creditors are gamers who have a semi ironic love for the store. So they started making names encouraging each other to punish the serious people by buying worthless GameStop stocks. Now, instead of failing, GameStop is succeeding wildly.

[00:03:00]
Not really. Of course not as a business. But come on, stocks are never real.

[00:03:06]
The serious people have already lost five billion dollars and some giant hedge funds have gone bankrupt.

[00:03:13]
Got it. Good.

[00:03:16]
Now let's get out Mogel Robi's bathroom before she gets home and asks me what I'm doing here. The last time she called me here was a bit awkward.

[00:03:25]
OK, now that we're on the same page, yo this shit is wild and I know some people are freaking out about this. People like this isn't how Wall Street is supposed to work. What's going to happen to these poor hedge funds?

[00:03:38]
Let me tell you something. Wall Street is going to be fine. All right? There are millions of people who are out of work and thousands of businesses closing. And yet the stock market is an all time high. No worried about hedge fund guys. They can cry about this from their helicopter that takes them to their boat. That takes them to their yachts.

[00:03:55]
In fact, if anything, I think it's actually funny to see how Wall Street doesn't like it when somebody's Wall Street to them. Yeah, because when they make moves that cost people their homes, people in Wall Street are like, hey, man, those are the rules. But when it happens to them, like, those aren't the rules.

[00:04:09]
The one going to regulate this and these Redit investors already moving beyond GameStop.

[00:04:15]
Now they're pumping up the stock prices of other failing companies like Bed, Bath and Beyond, AMC movie theaters and even Tootsie Rolls, which, by the way, I didn't even know that Tootsie Roll had its own stock. Who was that for? So it's a candy that looks and tastes like a turd, but it also sticks to your teeth. You're interested in investing. Now, if you think about it, the only reason that these Raddatz's have been able to pull this off is because of the Internet.

[00:04:46]
Yep. Think about it like Reddit and all these social media. They make it possible to get together with people who think like you. This wasn't possible decades ago. Like now, if you want to take down a hedge fund, you can find people to help you do it. If you want to plan an insurrection, you can find people to help you do it. So if you think you're the only person in the world who's attracted to that part of a stapler, that looks like a face.

[00:05:09]
Well, I'll see you at hot stapler faces dot com, my friend.

[00:05:12]
Mm mm mm. The GameStop stock explosion, you know, it's the reason your 14 year old cousin just bought a Ferrari, traders on Reddit sent the stock soaring this week, causing billions in losses for the hedge funds that bet against the video game retailer's stock. And today, Wall Street decided enough was enough. And this is a Fox News alert.

[00:05:37]
Now draw your attention to Main Street, where GameStop and AMC shares have been tumbling and trading action today as a growing number of firms move to halt trading on some stocks boosted by amateur traders on Reddit. The action is so wild that TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have restricted trading of these stocks. Wells Fargo also banning its advisors from telling clients to buy or sell GameStop and AMC.

[00:06:04]
Now, the criticism centered on Robert for abandoning their followers here in favor of helping those who had shorted all these stocks in the first place.

[00:06:11]
I don't particularly like the move on Robin Hood today. I'm talking to people this morning that say, OK, that is anticapitalism, you can't do that. A class action complaint was just filed in the southern district of New York against Robin Hood. And this is what part of it says, and I'm quoting purposefully, willfully and knowingly, Robin Hood, remove the stock GME GameStop from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise. Thereby it goes on manipulating the open market.

[00:06:43]
Yeah, that's right, people. Wall Street was getting rocked so hard by average people buying stock in GameStop that they just stopped average people from buying it. Yeah, the same guys, the same guys who are always like the markets must never be regulated. They must always remain free.

[00:07:02]
Those same guys are now like, oh, shit, the poor people got a hold of the freedom to turn it off, turn off the freedom.

[00:07:08]
So thanks to this ban, the GameStop stock that a lot of people bought for a ton of money is now worth a lot less, which is probably familiar to anyone who sold a used game back to GameStop. So right now, a lot of people are understandably upset about what Wall Street is doing.

[00:07:25]
In fact, it's bringing together people from all sides.

[00:07:28]
I mean, Ailsa and Ted Cruz are as far apart as Madison and Austin, and even they're both blasting the Robinhood app for blocking users from buying GameStop stocks. Everyone's mad. Even people like Yahoo! Jaru who tweeted, Yo, this is a good grab. What Robin Hood is doing, do not sell. And let me tell you something. When the guy who did the fire festival thinks that you're a fraud man and you're doing some shady shit.

[00:07:56]
Last week, you probably remember day traders on read it shocked the markets by driving stocks in GameStop, an AMC movie theaters higher than the Queen's here in Britain. But now Reddit has its eye on something even more shiny.

[00:08:09]
The GameStop saga continues to grow. It's not just stocks anymore, though. Reddit users are buying up silver, pushing up the value of the precious metal. Silver has now hit a five month high at nearly 30 bucks an ounce. That Redit group says that they're doing it because big banks, specifically JP Morgan Chase, have been, quote, suppressing metals for a long time.

[00:08:31]
Over the weekend, retail sites that sell silver coins and silver bars said that they were getting hit by unprecedented demand and they couldn't meet the demand.

[00:08:40]
It's been incredible. Pretty much physical silver. It's almost all gone in terms of life inventory.

[00:08:45]
We typically have about a thousand silver products in inventory available for purchase. We're getting so cleaned out right now that we're actually, last I checked, down to about 80 items in stock, which is a number I've never seen before and never thought we would ever see. The entire industry is frankly wiped out in terms of actually finding live silver that you can purchase and receive today. It's becoming impossible.

[00:09:07]
Oh, haemorrhaged Chaitanya. Oh, that's right, people.

[00:09:14]
Now, silver prices are skyrocketing, which is going to cause confusion at the next Olympics. I mean, if silver is more valuable than gold, everyone's going to try and get second place.

[00:09:22]
Sprinters will be at the finish line like after you met FDR, but after, you know, you always going first. But I'm always going first. You go ahead of me. Why don't you go ahead of me and this time you can go first.

[00:09:33]
Right now, while some Reddit users say that driving silver prices higher will cripple banks like JP Morgan, others claim that this movement is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms because it would help the banks. And I believe this because, of course, Wall Street will do that when Wall Street sees a scam going, it doesn't try to stop it. It tries to join in. If Wall Street caught you, robbing its mom would be like, hey, hey, I don't want to take off our shoes.

[00:09:59]
Sometimes she has cash in there. Get in there. Let me get in there with.

[00:10:02]
It's coordinated by the banks themselves a lot. The fact is the credit surge is now spreading from game stock to silver to all sorts of stocks.

[00:10:10]
And one of our correspondents has a pitch for where it should go next. Are you a creditor looking to stick it to the hedge funds? Well, forget about GameStop and Silver.

[00:10:19]
You got to invest in Kiwi's. I'm delighted. And Kiwis are the investment opportunity that Wall Street doesn't want you to know about their portable. They hold their intrinsic value. And it's easy to think you're ordering ten from Amazon and miraculously wind up with ten crates.

[00:10:38]
Here's a fact. As far as we know, every single hedge fund is shorting Kiwis. And are we going to let them do that to America's national fruit? I don't think so. But if we all buy Kiwis, then rocket ship and Kiwis are more than an investment.

[00:10:58]
They go great in fruit salads. They can be organic, track nuts, and they're the only fruit covered in fur. So if you ever wonder what it's like to take a bite out of a hamster, now you can with Kiwis.

[00:11:15]
And the best part is you don't even have to go through those Wall Street fat cats to get your Kiwi's, just call me and let me know how many you want, whether five or five thousand.

[00:11:26]
But this opportunity will not last forever.

[00:11:29]
Got maybe two days tops before it smells so bad in here that my landlord kicks me out. So order now. And remember, the more Kiwis we all buy, the more the hedge funds suffer.

[00:11:40]
It's just economics. So called today.

[00:11:44]
Please, honey, what did you do? I'm handling it.

[00:11:53]
Doug Henwood, welcome to the daily social distancing show here. Good to be here. From a distance. Yes. Yes, indeed. And it's it's a perfect time for you to be happy. You have really established yourself as somebody who is not just aware of the market and participates in the market, but also calls Wall Street out for what it really is. The biggest story right now is GameStop, Wall Street hedge funds and just a lot of money that is no way and yet everywhere in the shortest way possible.

[00:12:23]
How would you break this down to somebody who had no idea what was going on?

[00:12:27]
Most people, most civilians who don't really know the markets very well have the sense that it's all a big racket, kind of ludicrous, not that different from the casino, like all this image that Wall Street likes to cultivate about itself, that it's rational and it's at allocating capital efficiency and all that efficiently and all that. It's just nonsense. It's not doing any of those things. It does a little of it. But mostly it's just a game to try to outwit your competitors and people on the other side of a trade, whatever, and run away with the most money.

[00:12:56]
It's just there's nothing terribly rational. It's driven by emotions and psychology and fear. And most recently, over the last year or so, by a gusher of something like three trillion dollars in Federal Reserve money, which is been power, the market. So it's that sense that a lot of people have that this is all a bit of a racket is completely accurate.

[00:13:17]
So it seems like like you're saying, it's like basically people came into the casino and said, we're going to play against the house and we're going to make a lot of money. What's interesting here is a market that is oftentimes termed free and capitalistic has now been stopped. Can you explain that element? Why why was why was it stopped? Have these people broken the rules? Have they have they done anything wrong?

[00:13:37]
Well, I think there are a couple of things going on. One is these predators, they're just the wrong kind of people, but they're playing the same game that Wall Street does and they're getting together, talking up a stock, talking down a stock, trying to figure out the other guy's positions, looking who's weak, attacking them. They do Wall Street professionals do that sort of thing all the time. And I think it's very funny to hear their professions of outrage that this is just not moral.

[00:14:00]
You know, it's not fair. It's like the markets are supposed to be, you know, on the up and up and these guys are not playing fair. That's just utter nonsense. They're just the wrong kind of people. But I think the other thing is. Yeah, are they just trying to protect their own?

[00:14:12]
And Robin Hood a little likes to present itself as the democratic institutions and democratic broker for the masses are going to overturn the Wall Street order.

[00:14:23]
It's deeply plugged into the Wall Street establishment. That's how they make their money. They feed their orders to establish brokers who then make money on those trades by taking a little a little bit of the price.

[00:14:37]
So I think they are trying to make the market, but they're also trying to keep the fences up, make sure the ruble can't crash the party.

[00:14:46]
So then two questions. One, what does this tell us about Wall Street and the market and to what do we do to improve this? Because it feels like an unfair system.

[00:14:55]
It is an unfair system. It's a deeply unfair system. And one of the things that make me suspicious about all this talk of democratizing the stock market is that the distribution of income and wealth is very undemocratic. And there's nothing that you can do about that, nothing that a trading platform can do to change any of that. I mean, the fundamentals of the society are not going to change because some people in red, it got to play in the stock market.

[00:15:18]
But what does it tell you about Wall Street? It is largely of little economic significance. The standard story is that the stock market exists to raise money for productive corporations, to invest in capital equipment, buildings, hire people, do R&D.

[00:15:37]
It does almost none of that. The market really is more about extracting value from companies.

[00:15:44]
For shareholders. It's it really is a machine for extracting value. For the top one percent of society, the ownership of stocks is extremely concentrated. Something like ninety five percent of all stocks are owned by the richest five percent. And, you know, if you guys aren't ready, they're really not going to change that fundamental fact.

[00:16:03]
So full of people who are on it's, you know, for the people who came in because they liked that, you know, that GameStop got a new CEO. You know, those people who who actually wanted to invest, the people who said, I believe in a future or screw the hedge funds, what position will they? And now, I mean, are they at risk of losing a lot of money now or are they in a position where they've made so much from the initial investment that if they get out, they're generally going to be fine?

[00:16:27]
Yeah, I think you're going to exit a position. You just can't start a new one, which is somewhat reasonable. OK, but, you know, I think some some people are going to really lose a lot of money if people who are sensible enough sold into this rally. You know, if you bought it at 50 or 100 and sold it three hundred or three hundred and fifty, you're doing pretty nicely. But just looking at the the the chart for trading in GameStop today, it was, you know, went from.

[00:16:51]
Like three hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty, you know, during the course of the day, it's been an utterly crazy, wild ride, none, none of it making much sense at all. Now, I think a lot of people, however, are going to hold onto their positions hoping that, well, if it went to three fifty, it can go to a thousand. On Twitter today, somebody said to me, 4000 with, you know, eight or ten rocket emojis afterwards.

[00:17:14]
This is the nature of bubbles. You know, this larger issue here is that the entire stock market is in an epic bubble. I mean, it really one of the great bubbles of all time. The market has only been valued this highly at a couple of previous times in history for 2000, at the peak of the dotcom bubble and 1929 before the great crash. So, you know, where it's really crazy territory and things like this are a sign that maybe things are just a little frothy.

[00:17:39]
But, you know, I think there is that sense that when people get people who are new to the market, get this deeply involved as kind of a sign that things are are ripening, shall we say. There's a saying in Wall Street that a bear market is when money returns to its rightful owners. And I think, you know, I don't know what's going to set off that bear market. Bubbles always go further than you think they could.

[00:18:04]
There's certainly no rationality to this at all. But at some point, somebody is going to be left holding a very depleted bag.

[00:18:11]
Before I let you go, does the person who is holding the depleted bag determine how the situation is dealt with? So if the big players on Wall Street, if they're the ones holding the depleted bag, is it going to be dealt with differently from the government versus if, like the people on the ground are holding the depleted bag? Oh, absolutely.

[00:18:29]
There's nothing right now that we can see that would require any kind of government bailout. A couple of hedge funds may blow up, but nobody cares. There's no systemic risk around that. You know, much the worse for them.

[00:18:38]
But, you know, I think if some Wall Street people left, left, left, left, holding the bag, there may be some bail out if you know larger entities than just a few hedge funds got into trouble, we'll have a government bailout. That's always what happens. Wall Street's quite an amazing game there. It's always this that every 10, 15 years they seem to run into a wall and the government bailed them out. So, you know, they learn that they can get away with anything.

[00:19:08]
There's a famous story about Sonny Barger, the old Hells Angel who woke up from a coma after a motorcycle accident. And the nurse said to him, well, I hope you learned your lesson. Mr. Barger said, yes, I did. She said, what's that?

[00:19:20]
He said, I can do anything and survive to that. Wall Street cultivates. They can do anything to survive. The only thing that would really change anything is if there enough popular outrage that said, we really need to regulate this casino. Seriously, we didn't really have that serious set of reforms after the 2008 financial crisis. Right. You know. All right. But not serious. It was not like the reforms that happened after twenty nine to thirty two.

[00:19:47]
So maybe, maybe, maybe if we see some kind of very serious mash up, we might finally wake up and have some kind of regulation of this business.

[00:19:57]
And that would. Thank you so much for joining us on the show. I hope to see you again anytime. Thanks. Hey, guys, Ben Bay here, and I'm the creator of a crazy little show called BLAW Concern for Comedy Central Digital. And I'm Christopher Hitchens, plus the voice of Clarkson, whose name is well, son, we made this insane show at the studio that makes robot chicken.

[00:20:14]
Markinson is a mixed media puppet show that follows an overly manly father named Blac, who desperately tries to connect with his overly nerdy son.

[00:20:21]
We got some really cool people involved just in Royal and Donald Faison, Jane Lynch, Jim Rash, Debra Baker, Jr..

[00:20:27]
It's a really fun show that we're really proud of, and it's available right now on Comedy Central's YouTube channel.

[00:20:32]
So go check it out. The Black Effect Podcast Network is the largest podcast publisher dedicated to black listeners, Charlamagne, the God calls it the place where black voices are heard. We have the most influential and trusted voices in black culture. There's comedy on the eighty five s show Sportstalk on all the smoke, justice and culture, on street politicians dating and relationships, on horrible decisions and more experience. All black, everything, everything. Black is the black officer.

[00:20:58]
Listen to all the Black Effect podcast network shows on Apple podcasts. The GameStop uprising, the biggest thing to happen with video games since Solich got busted for doping, but if you haven't heard the news, what happened was that some Wall Street hedge funds bets a lot of money that the stock price of the video game store GameStop would fall. But a bunch of people on Reddit found out about those bets. So they started buying GameStop shares so that the price would go up and the hedge funds would lose a lot of money and lose a lot of money they did in the billions of dollars.

[00:21:36]
So as you can imagine, Wall Street is pretty unhappy with those Reddit investors.

[00:21:42]
A handful of industry leaders are calling for an investigation because of the angry mob that's formed against them.

[00:21:49]
Last week was a free market. It was a free for all market, no doubt about it.

[00:21:53]
For my twenty five years in the business, I've never seen this form of collusion on such a widespread fashion. This type of behavior is not the behavior that you want to be replicating. I think there is something obviously wrong, and it's the gamification of Wall Street.

[00:22:10]
Talk to an analyst this morning, guys, who said this is dangerous. They forget they're buying a stock and a piece of a company.

[00:22:16]
It's not just some symbol that you play hot potato with it just because you throw the Hail Mary pass in your back yard and it's caught for the touchdown in the wind. Doesn't mean you're Tom Brady.

[00:22:26]
What's going through my mind is how irrelevant I feel and how every day I just don't want to get out of bed and how it's the least amount of fun I think I've ever had. Oh, man.

[00:22:38]
These Wall Street guys are taking this so hard that the interviews are just turning into therapy sessions.

[00:22:44]
I feel so irrelevant right now and I'm not having any fun. And I just remembered my parents never hung my paintings on the refrigerator.

[00:22:53]
But the truth is, what the Redskins did here is nothing new. In fact, the only thing that makes this so unique is that this is just the first time that the little guy has used the big guys tactics against him, because when it comes to manipulating the market and treating trades like a game, no one is better at it than Wall Street. I mean, they do this shit all the time. In fact, let's take a look at a few examples, starting with a scam one big bank pulled just a few years ago.

[00:23:19]
The New York Times reporting over the weekend that Goldman Sachs is running a scheme to artificially inflate aluminum prices.

[00:23:26]
An aluminum warehouse controlled by Goldman Sachs holds the equivalent of a quarter of the annual North American demand for the metal, but only offloads or distributes a required minimum of three thousand tons a day. No more, no less. Whatever the demand is pushing prices of the metal higher even as demand is declined. Goldman profits from this practice two ways.

[00:23:47]
First, from the extended rents paid to store the metal, and second, by the bets made on aluminum futures by its trading arm.

[00:23:54]
The inflated aluminum pricing by Goldman and other financial players has cost American consumers five billion dollars over the last four years. Yeah, that's right.

[00:24:04]
Basically, Goldman Sachs manipulated the supply of aluminum by only letting out a little bit at a time. You know, the same way Daniel Day Lewis limits the supply of movies isn't I mean, the dude's only been in six movies over the past twenty years. The Rock made that many movies yesterday. Get to work.

[00:24:21]
Danny, by the way, for the rest of the segment, I'm going to be pronouncing its aluminum, even though the correct pronunciation is aluminium. But we had a vote and all the people I work with our American. And so they won and I didn't want to accept the election result. But then I was like, no, we don't do that again. And I'm sorry, guys, but aluminum should never be hoarded. It needs to be used the way God intended to make condoms for robots or for lingerie.

[00:24:47]
Taylor Green to wear as a hat. And believe it or not, Goldman Sachs got away with the scheme for years until people caught onto it.

[00:24:56]
So I guess you could say that their aluminum plan was foiled.

[00:25:02]
Wow.

[00:25:04]
Brown, brown, brown. Now, as crazy as this is, it's actually a common tactic with Wall Street.

[00:25:11]
You take over a market and then manipulated supply to drive up the price, like how JPMorgan Morgan used its control over electricity to fund these California JPMorgan Chase accused of manipulating energy prices and so driving up the electric bills of millions of Americans at night when energy prices are very low, essentially, they would bid them up so that in the morning the companies would go to buy energy and find the prices artificially high. It takes a few hours to get a power plant going.

[00:25:40]
So they would have to buy the energy in the morning when it was very, very expensive. In one case, JPMorgan duped California utilities into paying nine hundred ninety nine dollars per megawatt hour when the going rate was only twelve dollars.

[00:25:55]
Yo, this shit is crazy. It's like these guys were sitting around a table like I'm tired of just abusing our power metaphorically. Let's do it for real. Basically because of JPMorgan, the cost of electricity. Went up from 12 dollars per megawatt to almost a thousand dollars per megawatt, even Omeish people were like, yo, I don't even know what electricity is, but that shit is messed up. I hope the Amish community doesn't come off to me on Twitter for that one.

[00:26:21]
I mean, at that price, I would actually be less upset if you jumped me and robbed me. At least then it feels like you had to work for it. And the truth is, people, this isn't something hedge fund people are ashamed of. In fact, some of them even brag about it on the TV.

[00:26:37]
Jim Cramer once made a fortune running a successful hedge fund. He went on to host his own TV show, Mad Money, that offers stock tips to investors. But as Cramer has found out lately, a lot of Americans are mad at him. This video, made in 2006, has suddenly gone viral. Cramer explains to his own financial website, The Street Dotcom, how he could influence stock prices up and down as the manager of a massive hedge fund.

[00:27:00]
You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money, but it's a fun game and it's a lucrative game. And I would encourage anyone who's in the hedge fund game to do it because it's legal and it is a very quick way to make money and very satisfying.

[00:27:28]
By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that, but I hear these people got no shame, no shame, zero, nada, zilch. He's just out here boasting about his evil plans. I mean, the only people who do that are hedge fund guys and bond villains. I mean, listen to him, listen to him talk about it. It's legal and it's very satisfying. Just as a general rule, whenever you have to remind someone that something is legal, it's probably shady.

[00:27:54]
You know, no one's ever like, hey, Trevor, you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory? It's legal. But when it comes to hurting people in order to make a buck, nothing compares to the Great Recession of 2008, which was caused by guess who?

[00:28:10]
Wall Street manipulating the markets during the hot housing market, banks took millions of home mortgages, many held by people who could not afford them and bundled them into packages as mortgage securities. JP Morgan today admitted that it sold those packages to investors, even though its executives knew that many of the mortgages were highly suspect. When the market collapsed, those packages became mostly worthless.

[00:28:33]
Goldman sold investors subprime mortgage packages, but then made its own bet those same investments would lose value without telling investors. Goldman employees themselves use profanity to disparage the deals.

[00:28:47]
Boy, that Timberwolf was one deal.

[00:28:50]
And when asked if any of the executives at least felt partly responsible for the financial collapse, there's things that we wish we could have done better in hindsight or even regret.

[00:29:00]
Regret to me means something that you feel like you did wrong. And I don't have that.

[00:29:06]
When you hear your own employees or read about those in the emails, you feel anything? I, I think that's very unfortunate to have on e-mail. Are you embarrassed and and very unfortunate. I don't have emails and please don't take that feeling that way. I think it's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that.

[00:29:25]
God damn even the crowd. Do you see them? Even the crowd in the chamber was like, oh, you know how bad you have to screw things up to turn a Senate hearing into a Jerry Springer taping. But this is how you know, how psychotic these guys are. Not only did they tank the economy, but they talk about emotions like they're serial killers. Do you regret hurting these people? Regret is a thing that one feels when one has done something wrong.

[00:29:51]
I mean, how can you expect these guys to change their behavior when they can't even express their remorse? The closest Wall Street comes to reflecting is doing Coke off of a mirror. So after all the damage Wall Street has done to people's lives, please miss me with all of this whining about how unfair it is for Reddit to boost GameStop. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all these guys are heroes, but I will say it has been fun watching how some of the people who got rich off of GameStop have been spending their money.

[00:30:22]
While GameStop has minted plenty of millionaires, many retail investors are using their more modest profits to pay bills.

[00:30:29]
When Reddit user even posting that he paid off his student loan debt thanks to the money he's made off of GameStop the last few days.

[00:30:35]
A ten year old Jaden Carr. Two years ago, his mom bought him 10 shares of GameStop as a Kwanzaa gift. Back then, they were six dollars each. Now he sold them for more than three thousand dollars. What are you going to do with the money that you've made on GameStop?

[00:30:50]
I am already saying two thousand two hundred fifty thousand.

[00:30:56]
The best hunter can cashed in on the GameStop phenomenon last week, but didn't just cash in for himself. He used some of the money he made to donate six and a. Tendo switches and games to the children's hospital in Minnesota, one day trader who cashed in on the craze walked into a GameStop store this week and started handing out hundred dollar bills to employees.

[00:31:18]
After the Robinhood app halted trading on GameStop, one investor chartered a plane to fly a banner over the company's headquarters saying, Suck my nuts, Robinhood. Oh, that's a gangsta move right there.

[00:31:29]
It's like Twitter, but in the sky now, you could say it's childish to spend money you took from Wall Street to dunk on Wall Street. And that may be. But in the words of Jim Cramer, it's legal and very satisfying.

Now, my new podcasts return, man. I'll discover that his death still makes no sense at all.
