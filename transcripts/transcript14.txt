Hey, what's going on, everybody? I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is February twenty third, which means it's the last week of Black History Month. And that's why, once again, my friends, I've decided to make new black history by becoming the first black person ever to lose a dance off to a white guy. I tried to lose.

[00:01:25]
I really tried. Brice I'm sorry, man. Next time, man. Anyway, on tonight's show, Roy Wood Junior celebrates black journalists mean tweets are destroying President Biden's cabinets. And the Republican Party is already hard at work rigging the next election. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:42]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's Koch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with criminal. Here's. Let's kick things off with some health news if you're watching this show while you're driving. First of all, don't do that. And second, you may want to hold your breath for this.

[00:02:09]
Hey, we all love that new car smell. Right? But according to a new study, that scent could be dangerous. Researchers found the smell carries in it dangerous carcinogens, the measured high levels of cancer causing particles in the air and dust inside cars, formaldehyde and benzene are used by manufacturers in carpets and leather and paints in the cabin. And researchers say drivers with long commutes are likely the most at risk.

[00:02:31]
Oh, man, come on. Why are scientists such killjoys? I mean, just once I'd like to hear about a new study that says something fun was good for you, but it's always like, oh, puppies give you gonorrhea. I mean, that's where I got mine from.

[00:02:47]
But yes, apparently new car smell is carcinogenic, which luckily for me, isn't a problem because I haven't been able to smell anything in months. Yeah. Oh, wait. And yeah, it really shouldn't come as a surprise that such an unnatural smell is bad for you. I mean, you'll never find something in a botanical garden that smells like a Sorento. But please, we should be clear. The fact that something emits carcinogens does not mean that it causes cancer.

[00:03:18]
The most dangerous thing about driving is still driving. I mean, think about it. Every single person you know, has at some point in their life tripped while walking up the stairs. Everyone has now put that person in charge of a four thousand pound piece of metal going 70 miles an hour. That seems like a bigger problem than a smell that might make you sick in 30 years. Now, obviously, people who are driving old cars have nothing to worry about, although their next visit to the doctor is going to be real uncomfortable.

[00:03:48]
The good news is you do not have cancer. The bad news is you're a broke ass bitch. Now, there are treatment options, but Lord knows you can't afford any of them. Moving on from new car smells to the man who still got that new president smell, Joseph, Range Rover, Biden. Biden has nominated one of the most diverse cabinets ever. It's called Black People, Women, Hispanics, Native Americans and even child robots. But first, Biden's nominations have to be approved by the Senate.

[00:04:23]
And one of Biden's lesser known picks has run into some trouble over her itchy Twitter fingers.

[00:04:29]
Consideration of Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget is now, frankly, in jeopardy after more senators have come out against her. Republicans Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah all citing tendons, past tweets criticizing Republicans. A Romney spokesperson called them mean tweets.

[00:04:49]
You wrote that Susan Collins is, quote, the worst to Tom Cotton is a fraud, that vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz called leader McConnell must go Mitch and Voldemort and on and on. There are still nine pages of tweets about Senator Ted Cruz, for example.

[00:05:10]
Read them, read the tweets, read every single one of those tweets.

[00:05:17]
Look, I'm glad to see Melania's best program is finally paying off, but if tweeting mean things about Ted Cruz disqualifies you from serving in government, well, there's not going to be any one left to run the country. Even Mitch McConnell would be out in the streets like Ted Cruz. Looks like a Wolverine after a bad divorce. Shammed, I resign. I was worth it.

[00:05:42]
Regardless, though, I will say it is really nice to see that Republican senators have finally figured out how to read mean tweets, because just six months ago, whenever a reporter asked a Republican senator to comment on a Trump tweet, well, then they would say they hadn't seen it and then jump out of a window, grab onto a letter attached to a helicopter and fly out of there. Now, Neera Tanden did apologize for her tweets, but I think that was her biggest mistake.

[00:06:14]
If Donald Trump has taught us anything, it's that doubling down on being an asshole is how you earn Republicans respect. She should have come into that hearing like Senator. I never would have called you a sweaty bitch if I had known just how bad you smelled your smelly ass, sweaty bitch.

[00:06:33]
I vote to confirm.

[00:06:35]
And finally, the coronavirus vaccine, a.k.a. Zoom's worst nightmare. For many people, the vaccine is still too hard to guess, which is why some Floridians are already pissed off that their governor appears to be playing favorites.

[00:06:50]
The vaccine rollout in Florida surrounded a new controversy tonight.

[00:06:55]
Governor Ronda Santos is accused of. Playing politics with the coronavirus vaccine, a state covid vaccination site popped up in a very wealthy exclusive neighborhood, and many Florida residents want the governor to keep vaccine distribution fair. Listen to Governor de Santos.

[00:07:11]
I'll tell you what I mean. I wouldn't be complaining. I'd be thankful that we're able to do it, because you know what? We didn't need to do this at all. We saw a need. We want to get the numbers out for seniors.

[00:07:20]
He struck a deal with a Republican donor of his who had developed a large, largely white Republican community and a Republican elected official to basically send additional vaccine to Republican voters.

[00:07:33]
OK, I know this sounds bad, but if you ask me, the most hardcore Republicans should be vaccinated first.

[00:07:43]
I said it's because think about it. They're the ones going into bars without mosques and feeding each other mouth to mouth like baby birds. If we vaccinate their asses, it'll stop them from infecting the rest of us. And look, I get that people are upset that the may have given preferential treatment to his supporters. But if that's true, can you blame the man? I mean, if I got extra doses of the vaccine, I would also give them to my friends.

[00:08:09]
Maybe the blame should be on all those poor black people who never made the effort to be friends with Governor Rhonda Sanctus. Hmm. I mean, maybe a few people have taken the time to say hi or ask him how he was doing or donate a million dollars to his campaign. Maybe you wouldn't be in this situation. He. But it doesn't really matter what anybody is saying, because the SANCTUS isn't letting the accusations get to him. In fact, now he's introducing an even more exclusive vaccine program for his top VIPs.

[00:08:40]
Florida looking for the red carpet treatment for your covid vaccine. Then come on down to Rhonda Sanchez's club. Banks make the donations rain cut to the front of the line to get vaccinated. Leatherbacks offers first rate vial service straight to the table with sparklers. Skip the whip sign, skip the phone calls, skip the all people in line. You earned the club X every night is two for one shot night, classy and classes and all the Floridians who got stopped by the bouncer.

[00:09:10]
Keep this in mind. I wouldn't be complaining. I'd be thankful that we're able to do a round of fantasies club backs putting the play in the play. All right, let's move on now to our main story, tonight's voting. It's how America speaks to the manager.

[00:09:28]
And if you're about to say but Trevor, I just voted in November. The whole point is not to have to think about it for another four years. Well, listen up. Because if you don't pay attention, you might not be able to vote again in four years for fraud, claims are now fueling GOP efforts to roll back to restrict voter access.

[00:09:47]
Thirty three state legislatures have already introduced one hundred and sixty five bills to restrict voting access just since last month. Florida restricting vote by mail after nearly five million Floridians voted that way last year.

[00:10:01]
In Pennsylvania, Republicans are trying to roll back mail and voting expansions. They passed just two years ago in New Hampshire. They're trying to require voter ID for absentee ballots while banning the use of student IDs in Arizona.

[00:10:13]
One proposal would even allow the legislature to override the secretary of state's certification of the electoral votes.

[00:10:19]
If they're not happy with the result, they can just change it. Yes, Republicans saw the record number of people exercising their rights to vote and they said, yo, that shit cannot happen again. And some of these proposals are really extreme, right? This Arizona law would let the legislature just override the decision of the voters. Once that happens, what's the point of even voting? Arizona is going to have to update their stickers. When I get it, I get it.

[00:10:47]
I mean, Republicans have to make it harder to vote so that they have a better chance of winning elections. The only other option for them is to change their policies, to appeal to a majority of voters. But come on, that's way too hard. Human beings will do whatever they can to avoid changing what they think. And this has been the story for all of human history. People don't like changing their minds. My friends, it appears that there are multiple solar systems, many more than we thought.

[00:11:13]
We have to change everything, huh? Yes.

[00:11:15]
Or we could just burn you at the stake. Come on, guys. So these votes of restrictions are popping up all over the country, sort of like the herpes of democracy. But there's one state where Republicans are going harder than anywhere, the one that just cost them.

[00:11:32]
The Senate's Georgia Republicans introduced a set of sweeping new bills to limit access to polls in that state.

[00:11:38]
Nearly a dozen bills that could make it harder to vote have already been introduced in the state Senate headline grabbing proposal requiring two copies of photo ID just to vote by mail. Others would end automatic voter registration, the use of ballot drop boxes and no excuse absentee voting.

[00:11:55]
One bill would also end early in-person voting on Sundays days when black churches have historically held something called souls to the polls drives to turn out their members and souls to the polls Wolf.

[00:12:12]
Maybe you're going to have to answer to black voters anymore, but you're still going to have to answer to Jesus. That's right. Georgia Republicans think that if they can ban early voting on Sundays, they can kill souls to the polls, which is when black worshipers go vote together right off to church.

[00:12:30]
Well, the joke's on you Republicans, because one thing you should have learned about black people is they can do church any time, any place. It doesn't even need to be on a Sunday show. When I was growing up, we went to church Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. We had morning cartoons, but Sunday we went double. And by the way, you got to love how racist today have to learn so much about black people just so that they can be racist.

[00:12:54]
I mean, back in the day, they could just say no, blacks allowed, but now they have to find out what black people do so that they can ban that. So now you have racist like no souls to the polls, no one with fresh claims and no one who watches insecure. Well, actually believe insecure is not on the air right now. I think all the black are watching reruns and girlfriends on Netflix. Of course, there's nothing new about states making it harder for people to vote.

[00:13:20]
I mean, we've all seen every election. There are lines longer than the ones on Dongjun Mirror. But one of the new laws being proposed would make waiting in those lines even harder.

[00:13:30]
There's a part of this bill that prohibits the handing out of food and water to voters. It says that nor shall any person give offer to give or participate in the giving of any money or gifts, including, but not limited to food and drink to an elector. So people would take water to people who were standing for hours in lines. This bill would make that a crime. Congratulations, Georgia.

[00:13:55]
You finally solved the issue of widespread voter hydration, Republicans, bullies, and you've got to admit they reduce the voting locations so that people have to wait in line for hours. And now they want to ban people from giving out food and water to people who are waiting in line. It's like every year they make it five percent harder to vote by 20, 30. The voting line is just going to be an American Ninja Warrior episode. I mean, if you guys are going to be evil, at least don't be so blatant about it.

[00:14:23]
Instead of banning water. Republicans should hand out even more water and then ban porta potties. Yeah. Now you're evil and clever. Now for the most. Republicans aren't coming right out and saying that they're passing these laws to stop Democrats and minorities from voting. Instead, they're taking the big lie that they used in the last election and recycling it to try and win the next one.

[00:14:50]
I do believe that the voting in this country is a privilege and the right and it's a right as well. But it ought to mean enough where you could put forth a little bit of effort in trying to cast your ballot. We're not taking away anybody's rights, but we are asking is we want a fair and honest election that doesn't have all the allegations that we had in this election cycle.

[00:15:15]
Those allegations, baseless claims of fraud, were promoted by Jones, who was recently stripped of a committee chairmanship following his efforts to undermine the presidential election.

[00:15:25]
Oh, that's impressive, man. This guy says we need new laws to address the bogus voter fraud allegations that he spread. What we have here, my friends, is a rare real life instance of a person both snotting it and belting it. I mean, for real, though, this is ridiculous. If you're going to make up evidence out of thin air and use it against black people, you should not be a lawmaker. You will join the police.

[00:15:48]
So that's the situation.

[00:15:50]
Republicans are trying to change the rules to make it easier for them to win elections. And people who are concerned about that basically have two choices.

[00:15:59]
One, you can make sure that these restrictions do not get passed or you can get your ass in line right now for Election Day. Twenty, twenty two. Oh, and you might want to make sure you bring your own water. All right. When we come back, we would just back with another episode of CP Time celebrating America's great black journalists.

[00:16:17]
Don't go away. We think America's finally ready for this, a show by black people, for all people about the black experience in America. It's time to go there. Coming Tuesday night on ABC, Soul of a Nation. All the pain, all the joy. Unafraid, funny, beautiful.

[00:16:37]
And there will be news coming to ABC Tuesday night at 10:00. Nonsense. So some of this is coming and I hope you'll watch Soul of a Nation.

[00:16:48]

[00:18:04]
Welcome back to the daily social distancing show, February, as you know, is Black History Month, and we're celebrating all month long with Roy Wood Junior honoring the unsung heroes of black history. In another episode of CP Time.

[00:18:26]
Hello and welcome to C.P. Time, the only show that's full of culture. Today, we'll be discussing black journalists, and when you think of black journalists, you think of Lester Holt from NBC or the great Gwen Ifill from PBS or Al Roker's legendary visit to the White House, the first black man to ever shot in the White House.

[00:18:53]
As I'm walking to the press room to pass a little gas here, only a little some extra came out Al Roker as the Jackie Robinson of going doo in his drawls.

[00:19:02]
But American history is also filled with legendary black journalists whose work has been overlooked.

[00:19:11]
Journalists like Marville Cook, who in nineteen twenty eight became the first female journalists at the New York Amsterdam News. Back then, a black woman writing for a newspaper was like an intelligent debate on Facebook just doesn't happen.

[00:19:28]
But Cook used her blackness to her advantage. Working undercover and reporting on issues that her white male colleagues would not like, abusive working conditions for domestic workers in the Bronx. Cook once even went undercover as a prostitute, and her courage and commitment to the job inspired me to do the same as I also went undercover as a prostitute in my three part YouTube documentary. Nobody wants to hit this. Currently sitting at 13 views and counting. Another notable black journalists was Max Robinson, Max Robinson in nineteen seventy eight, became the first African-American to co-anchor a network news broadcasts.

[00:20:16]
Robinson's smooth baritone was so compelling that a racist news station once hired him to read the news with the screen black in his face. Imagine having a voice so irresistible that even racists say you ain't touching my daughter's.

[00:20:34]
But you can penetrate my ears, oh, you won't. Now, despite facing discrimination, Robinson became a success and he did it in style. Legend has it that Robinson once showed up to cover a fire in Los Angeles while wearing a fur coat. That's like wearing a fishnet vest to a funeral. Which is also something I did in my three part YouTube documentary, Nobody Wants to hit this, The New York Times called it pitiful. It's is. And finally, Xernona Clayton, Xernona Clayton was the first black woman to host a TV show in the South, opening the door for future black women, television hosts like Oprah Winfrey, Tamron Hall and Wendy Williams, who I will not say anything bad about because I'm not trying to get dragged by.

[00:21:32]
Wendy, how you doing? From early on, it was clear that Xernona Clayton was capable of greatness before hosting her show, Xernona would meet with a KKK Grand Dragon every day to debate him, kind of like a real life Twitter beef. But unlike Twitter, Xernona actually convinced the Grand Dragon to change his mind, leave the hate group and denounce them entirely. It was an amazing conversation and a win win for The Clansman. He was able to stop wasting his life on racism.

[00:22:10]
And now he's got an extra pair of bedsheets with a couple of fun holes. But that's all the time we have today. I'm Roy Wood Jr. and this has been CP time.

[00:22:22]
Remember, we fought the culture.

[00:22:25]
You know, speaking of my documentary, maybe it's time to blow some of that extended footage. I've got this clip from when some chaps. I'm up to 15 dudes, I'm going viral. Thank you so much for that, Roy. All right. When we come back, I'll be talking with humanitarian Hugh Evans about his plan to end the pandemic for the entire planet.

He's the co-founder and CEO of Global Citizen, which earlier today launched a recovery plan for the world, a campaign to end covid-19 for all and kick start a global recovery.

[00:24:11]
We talked about that and so much more. Hugh Evans, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:24:18]
Thank you so much, Trevor. Global Citizen is known as an organization that is always fighting against the worst ills within society. For those who don't know, before we even get into it, what is global citizen? What are you actually doing and what does your organization mean?

[00:24:34]
It's a global citizen. Is a worldwide movement committed to the eradication of extreme poverty by 20 30. And we're really a membership organization. We've got over 11 million members around the world and they take action and they call on governments to make multibillion dollar pledges to help eradicate extreme poverty within our lifetime. So they might pledge towards global health, a global education. And then we hold those world leaders accountable to make sure they follow through on those pledges. And ultimately, those living in extreme poverty benefit most.

[00:25:05]
There is a lot of money that global citizens help raise. There are a lot of people's lives that you've helped impact. But 20, 20 has been a year where everything shut down, especially global citizens, huge events that you used to host to get people moving forward. Talk me through what your plans are for twenty, twenty one. Now, if people cannot be outside in big groups, hanging out together, raising awareness and pushing action. Yeah, so so last year, immediately after the pandemic struck, we got a phone call from Dr.

[00:25:36]
Tedros, the head of the show, and he said he wanted a global citizen to work with him and the show to raise urgent funding to provide personal protective equipment for frontline community health workers. And so we partnered with Lady Gaga and the show and we launched this campaign called One Well Together at home. And it ended up being broadcast all over the world. And it raised one hundred and twenty seven point nine million dollars to provide the frontline workers. Because I'm proud to tell you today that one hundred percent of that money has been fully disbursed and is providing PPY to community health workers all over the world now.

[00:26:12]
But then in response to that, we know that right now a bigger challenge has emerged. And that's the challenge of of getting a vaccine to everyone on the planet, because immediately after one will together at home, we partnered with the European Commission and we hosted a new campaign called Global Goal Unite for Our Future. And this was really calling on the G7 nations to step up and provide urgent funding to help fund the development of a vaccine. And we were amazed because all all seven of the G7 leaders pledged a total of one point five billion dollars that went to fund both the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccines.

[00:26:48]
So in light of that, we now know that we have such a huge job ahead of us. So earlier this morning, global citizen Ambassador Hugh Jackman and artist Billy Eilish, together with the head of the Dr. Tedros and the head of the European Union and the head of your own government, that the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, joined us to launch what we've called the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the world. This is five points designed to really put the world back on track to tackle and recover better together.

[00:27:22]
And so that's really the strategy for the year ahead.

[00:27:24]
It seems like a monumental task. I mean, global citizen is having a conversation that some people aren't even ready to have because of where developed nations are. And that conversation is what is going to be happening to developing nations, poorer countries who don't have the money for the vaccines, who may not have the infrastructure to roll out the vaccines, because many countries are saying, hey, I know that African countries are going to need the vaccine. I know that all of Asia people don't need the vaccine, but Americans don't even have the vaccine.

[00:27:52]
So when you are having these conversations, getting leaders to commit portions of the vaccine to poorer countries, how do you balance that out with the people in those countries who are saying, well, we need the vaccines, how can we be committing some of our vaccines to other people?

[00:28:06]
Well, as I think we've all seen this with the new variants that are emerging of Copan 19, this truly is a global challenge because you could get vaccinated tomorrow. Will your grandma or your mom or your cousin could get vaccinated. But then if a new variant emerges from somewhere in the world that's entirely vaccine resistant, what good is it? Your vaccine will become redundant. So even if you're entirely selfish and don't really care about others, it's in your own self-interest to care because this is a global challenge.

[00:28:33]
And so that's the case we've been making to world leaders. And amazingly, people are starting to step up. We saw President Macron announced yesterday that he wanted to donate five percent of the vaccine load to support community health workers in the poorest nations. This morning, president of the line endorsed that as well. And we see an otherworldly to start to endorse that because this is a this is a global challenge. And you've got to remember that these vaccines, whether it's the Moderna vaccine, defies the vaccine.

[00:29:00]
They were funded with public money. So a public good. And so that's why it's not just about us acting as it as a gesture of charity. This truly is an act of equity and an act of justice to make sure that we actually can end the pandemic for everyone, everywhere.

[00:29:18]
There's no denying some of the parallels here between the covid-19 vaccine and antiretrovirals for HIV AIDS. You know, there was a time when the medical community have had developed all of these antiretrovirals and people were excited because they were like, wow, we can finally fight HIV AIDS. But the poorer countries who were being decimated the most couldn't afford the amount of of that drug that you needed and people couldn't afford to even buy it. So in the conversations you're having with these drug companies, are they stepping up and saying, yes, we will provide cheaper versions or we will provide this at a cheaper cost to developing nations?

[00:29:53]
So currently, both Johnson and Johnson and Oxford, AstraZeneca are providing nonprofit rates for their vaccines. But other drug companies such as Moderna, they're simply too expensive right now. And if you speak to some of the leading advocates across Africa who are working so hard to make sure that the supply chains reach the continent, they're extremely frustrated right now. They're frustrated by the slow pace. And as you said, it has so many parallels dating back to the 90s when HIV AIDS was ravaging across South Africa and antiretroviral drugs were available in the West.

[00:30:26]
But it took years and in some cases decade. For them to reach the poorest nations right now, there are literally one hundred and thirty countries who have not received a single vaccine. And so even if we think, OK, great, my summer will open up, I'll have a vaccine and I can get back to life as normal, it's just not the case because a new variant will emerge from somewhere on the planet and that will become ultimately, eventually vaccine resistant.

[00:30:52]
And you'll have to start the process all over again. And so that's why we have to act as a global community. Even if we're entirely inherently nationalistic, we have to do it for the sake of everyone.

[00:31:06]
You have thrown what I would argue or some of the greatest, biggest, best concerts. And I guess I mean, it is for charity. It is for good cause. It is to help people out. But those parties are amazing. In South Africa, for instance, you had Jay-Z and Beyonce headlining a show. I mean, Ed Sheeran was performing with Beyonce on stage. You had some of the biggest acts. The question is, what are you preparing for after the pandemic ends?

[00:31:31]
Do you have like a what's the what's a mega concert to celebrate the fact that the world is going back to normal? Have you have you even thought about what that's going to be and how I'm going to be involved?

[00:31:40]
Well, firstly, I should say you did an extraordinary job in South Africa. Oh, thank you. You didn't even have to bring that up. Thank you. No, I mean it.

You you were amazing. I mean, yes, it was amazing to have Beyonce and Jay-Z, but the fact that you as a native South African, were able to host them in your own country was absolutely brilliant. And our plan for this year is once we drive home this five point recovery plan for the planet, once we start to see progress on ending her unending covid-19 and not to focus on health, education, the environment and equity, once these other points start to come online this September, it is our dream to unite the whole planet with global citizen live all over the world.

[00:32:23]
So that's our goal. We know there's a long way to go to achieve that, and that's why we're doubling down this May. It's our plan to bring the whole world just as early as May this year to focus on two issues one, vaccine acceptance to equity. Because as you said earlier, even if you know, this has so many parallels to HIV AIDS.

[00:32:42]
Yes, sure. Like we did with polio, that we can eradicate this disease super quickly. And it's going to require two billion doses being made available to the poorest nations this year. And to put that into some perspective, because it might seem like a lot if we just right now allocated half of one percent of all the doses the G7 have already secured, that's enough to vaccinate every community health worker across Africa right now. So it's not a lot.

[00:33:12]
This is something that we can all do. And so, yes, we need pharmaceutical companies to provide that non-profit pricing we talked about earlier. It's one other opportunity I want to share with you this Friday, the G20, a meeting, and they're going to be making a decision about whether to unlock five hundred billion dollars in new financing through an IMF special purpose vehicle. This is one of those rare opportunities like what happened with the financial crisis, where the whole world can act as one and unlock new financing to end covid-19.

[00:33:44]
So we want the US government to step up. We want all of the G20 to step up and make this available because this will benefit the continent the most.

[00:33:53]
Well, it'll be exciting to see what you get up to. Congratulations on all the work you've done thus far and hopefully the next time I see you will be crowd surfing at another Beyonce concert.
