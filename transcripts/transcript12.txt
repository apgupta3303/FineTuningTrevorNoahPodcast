Hey, what's going on, everybody, I'm Trevor Noah, and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is February twenty fifth, which means it's the last week of Black History Month. And that's why my friends, I have decided for the final time that I am going to make new black history by becoming the first ever black Karyn. Hey, do you have a license for that skateboard you must play? I don't have to wear a mask. I pay taxes.

[00:01:39]
What an amazing day for people, I think I did pretty well anyway on tonight's show, why your tattoo could come back to haunt you. An explosive story about cats and why the state of America's electric grid will shock you. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:55]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Twitter. Noah A.

[00:02:11]
Folks, it's been a long, long, long week.

[00:02:16]
The pandemic reached a grim milestone. People in Texas struggle to get clean water. And now someone stole Lady Gaga dogs, which is crazy.

[00:02:26]
Do you know how hard it is to lure dogs away from someone who dresses in meat? So instead of ending the week on a frown, let's turn that thing upside down with another installment of Ray of Sunshine. One of the worst stories recently has been the crisis in Texas, but even that had a ray of sunshine as a bad situation brought out the best in some people.

[00:02:54]
In Houston, two strangers took in a delivery driver for five days after she got stranded during the storm. Last week, Chelsea Timmons says she got stuck outside their home while delivering groceries just as the brunt of that storm moved through. The couple trying to get a tow truck, but no one showed up, so they opened up their home to her.

[00:03:17]
Just come inside, hang out. We'll figure it out. And, you know, at some point we realized that we're probably gonna have a houseguest for a few days, which was fine.

[00:03:26]
Chelsea made an amazing coconut cake, too, to oh, that is the sweetest, most heartwarming abduction I have ever seen. This is like if the movie Get-Out was made by the Hallmark Channel. And, you know, these days when everyone is so suspicious and distrustful of strangers, it's really wonderful to hear about a couple that didn't hesitate for a second to help a stranger in need. In fact, you know what? I'm going to write them an email.

[00:03:52]
Dear American friends, I'm a Nigerian prince who has lots of money and you can't help me.

[00:04:00]
The only person who this isn't a happy story for is the guy who ordered coconuts that never showed up because, I mean, he was shivering in his house like, don't worry, kids, we're going to make it through this just fine.

[00:04:12]
Oh, man. Just as soon as those coconuts get here, let's move on to a ray of sunshine from Ohio, a story that starts out scary but ends scarily adorable.

[00:04:23]
An Ohio bomb squad made a surprise discovery, responding to a call about a suspicious bag found outside a church. Well, they weren't met with a ticking but perring coming from the back.

[00:04:36]
Six newborn kittens and their mother were discovered in a note that says Sprinkles had gone into labor the day earlier. And they're all being cared for. They're all well at the local animal shelter there.

[00:04:46]
Wow, what a relief that must have been. A bunch of kittens is the best thing you can hope to see when you're expecting to see a bump. I mean, it's like going to your grandpa's funeral, but instead, Beyonce pops out of the casket for a surprise concert. Oh, I mean, it's too bad you didn't get to bury your grandpa, but, hey, we all say in Bagram and Bagram.

[00:05:09]
So it really is great news that this wasn't a bomb, although after one week with seven cats in your house, you'll wish it had just been a bomb. And look, I know we should be careful, but did this really have to go straight to the bomb squad? I mean, like, it feels like a couple more questions on the nine one one call could have helped. OK, sir, is the bag meowing It is. All right, then.

[00:05:34]
Those are kittens, sir. Yeah, that's not a bomb. OK, bye bye. Nine one one.

[00:05:38]
What is your emergency? Mm hmm. Now is the fire. Meowing Yeah, those are kittens, ma'am. Yeah. That's not a fire. OK, then. Bye bye. Nine one one.

[00:05:48]
What's your emergency? At the same time, though, I will admit it is still too early to let our guard down. I mean, Bomas are really clever people, so this could be a long game. You know, you bring home those sweet kittens, you take care of them, you snuggle them, you listen to them purr, they become part of the family. And then one night, ten years from now, you open your eyes and your cat is on your chest holding a trigger button like boom, bitch.

[00:06:11]
Yeah. All right, let's move on now from six tiny kittens to one giant sheep and another great animal rescue story from the week rescuers in Australia found a sheep that had close to seventy eight pounds of wool dragging him down.

[00:06:27]
Look at this guy. He was underweight and all that gargantuan fleece even covered his eyes. The rescuers took him to Edgar's mission Farm Sanctuary. That's where he promptly received a good shearing. Sheep typically have to be shared at least once a year to keep them healthy. Look at all that.

[00:06:43]
Talk about the socks and the sweaters. Oh, man, I am so happy for that sheep. And he must have been relieved, too. I bet he was like, thank you. My dick looks so much bigger now. That's incredible though. They shaved seventy eight pounds of wool off of one sheep. That's enough to make one million for Bernie Sanders. And finally, here's a young woman whose good attitude turned her embarrassing mishap into Internet clouds.

[00:07:12]
A trend going around Tick is asking people to share their most regrettable tattoo. And it looks like one poor woman from Kentucky takes the cake.

[00:07:20]
OK, I'm just going to go ahead and let you guys know that I won. So I got this tattoo I've wanted it for a couple of years. Basically means, like, you know, being true to yourself in real and like not pretending to be something you're not. I got this March 4th twenty twenty and it says courageously and radically refused to wear a mask. She says she's not an a.m. says she was so embarrassed she wore long sleeved clothes all summer long to hide it.

[00:07:47]
All right.

[00:07:48]
You've got to feel bad for this woman just trying to make a personal statement and ending up on the wrong side in the culture wars.

[00:07:55]
I mean, the only way out of this thing is just to go full post Malone and get tattoos everywhere. Just stack them up. Yeah, because good luck picking out an individual message on that guy. He could have his ATM pin somewhere and then we wouldn't know. Nobody would know if this is the problem with getting a tattoo to express a personal statement, like if you're going to get a tattoo, people, there's a simple rule to follow. Just make sure you get a tattoo of something that will never change.

[00:08:19]
You know, like Mr. Potato Head, no matter what happens, Mr. Potato Head will always be missed. They did what? No, but you know what? Kudos, because she's laughing about it. She's having a good time. And even better news, she just got a primetime show on Fox News. For more on the story, I want to bring in my friend Desi Liddick. Desi, I know you love these kinds of stories as much as I do.

[00:08:43]
It's such bad luck, right? Yeah, I guess because, I mean, like, what are the chances of getting a tattoo where, like, things change and then all of a sudden that becomes like really controversial.

[00:08:57]
So it's like, oh, Trever can happen to anybody. Oh, I'm dizzy. I feel like I hit a nerve.

[00:09:06]
I feel like a hit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? You did hit a nerve. Treb, this lady isn't the only one dealing with this. I also got an inspirational tattoo that became kind of embarrassing this year.

[00:09:21]
What? Stop the steel wait, you think Trump had the election stolen from him? No, no, I got this in 2010 after a break up, it was to remind myself to stop letting bad relationships steal my precious time. Now, every time I wear short sleeves outside, I get a visit from the FBI.

[00:09:50]
Well, I mean, I'm really sorry, Daisy, but I guess I guess at least you can just wear long sleeves.

[00:09:55]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:09:57]
It doesn't help with the other one we like. You got another bad tattoo.

[00:10:03]
OK, but don't don't judge me. All right, please. I promise you what.

[00:10:10]
This one is small and tasteful on my knuckles. So I.

[00:10:17]
Cute. Whoa, Desi. What you believe in Kuhnen?

[00:10:21]
No, Trever I believe in the Q train.

[00:10:27]
OK, excuse me for supporting public transportation. I mean, how was I supposed to know that it would become the worst letter in the alphabet?

[00:10:35]
Oh, man. Wow. Wow. All right.

[00:10:39]
Well, I didn't realize how common this was maybe for the future, just like maybe you shouldn't get tattoos. It's probably safer.

[00:10:46]
You know, I well, I'm done, except I did just recently get a really special tattoo that you can't misinterpret. It's in Sanskrit on my neck.

[00:10:58]
Isn't it beautiful? Oh. My sense is rusty, but oh, Daisy, oh no, Daisy, that says Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself. Yeah, I know.

[00:11:13]
Wait, so you you think, you know what, let's not get into that, let's just. All right. Well well, good luck. Good luck with the tattoos and and life and stuff. This is weirder than I thought it was going to be.

[00:11:25]
I was thinking about getting a lizard person right on my calf. We should we wish I lost. I lost you, my wife, my wife, my brother. All right. When we come back, we'll figure out why all of America could end up like Texas. And Kevin Garnett is my guest on the show. So stick around.

[00:11:46]
We think America's finally ready for this, a show by black people, for all people about the black experience in America. It's time to go there. Coming Tuesday night on ABC, Soul of a Nation. All the pain, all the joy. Unafraid, funny, beautiful. And there will be news coming to ABC Tuesday night at 10:00. So some of this is coming and I hope you'll watch Soul of a Nation.

[00:12:15]
I'll be watching The Daily Show, Eres Edition.

[00:13:31]
Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Over the past week, we all watched the chaos unfold when Texases electric grid through the entire state into chaos. It was basically the biggest blackout since Brett Kavanaugh celebrated getting on the Supreme Court. But Texas is far from the only state to experience massive power outages. And the question is, why does America's energy grid have so many problems? Well, let's find out why. And another installment of If You Don't Know Now you know.

[00:14:09]
We all know how the electric system works, right? You plug your phone in, you unplug it, plug it back in, because it's only at 11 percent, and then you just stand by the wall all day scrolling through Instagram. But what's going on behind that wall might surprise you.

[00:14:24]
In 1882, on Pearl Street in New York City, Thomas Edison opened the world's first commercial electric grid, lighting up local homes and businesses with cables connected to his power station, the modern electric grid, next to seven thousand three hundred major power plants through nearly one hundred and sixty thousand miles of high voltage transmission lines and millions of miles of low voltage lines to bring power to over one hundred and fifty million customers.

[00:14:51]
There are only four distinct electrical grids that service essentially all of North America. You have the two big ones, Western and Eastern and the two electrical separatist, Quebec and Texas.

[00:15:02]
The electrical grid is the most massive machine that humans have ever built in the United States. We use something like five or six times more energy per person than anywhere else in the world.

[00:15:14]
Of course, Americans consume that much energy. Americans invented a bike that you have to plug in, doesn't even go anywhere and cost more than 10 regular bicycles. But yes, the electrical grid is the most massive machine that man has ever built. And it's amazing how it connects the entire continent. I mean, just think while you're blending a smoothie in your kitchen, Donald Trump is using the same electricity to shred his tax returns.

[00:15:43]
It's actually beautiful when you think about it.

[00:15:45]
Wow. So there's no doubt that this is an impressive system, unfortunately, much like a tweet from twenty ten. It hasn't aged well.

[00:15:54]
The US electric grid loses power almost three times more often than it did in 1980 for much more than any other industrialized nation. Japan loses power an average of four minutes a year. But in the northeast U.S., two hundred fourteen minutes. And it just keeps getting worse.

[00:16:10]
In 2010 alone, disruptions in our inefficient power grid cost our country in excess of one hundred billion dollars.

[00:16:17]
We actually lose about 60 percent of the energy that we generate.

[00:16:22]
Most of the infrastructure that we use today hasn't changed much since 30, 40, 50 years ago.

[00:16:28]
Some of the country's power systems predate the 20th century. If Thomas Edison walked into a modern substation, he'd feel very much at home.

[00:16:35]
Yeah, he would feel at home, especially if he saw Joe Biden on TV. A my old pal Joe was president. Joe, why are you so small? Get out of that box, Joe.

[00:16:48]
But this is pretty worrisome. America's living in twenty, twenty one with an electric grid that's barely been updated in the past 50 years. You have to update technology more often than that. People I mean, imagine trying to get through your life with the first iPhone. You couldn't even use the maps app because New York wasn't the state back then. So clearly, the grid needs to be upgraded and we'd better do it soon because the problem is heating up.

[00:17:13]
The last half century, there had been more and more power outages because of weather, and it will only get worse because of our changing climate.

[00:17:21]
The grids are facing more extreme conditions more often, and it's susceptible to really, really major failures.

[00:17:27]
Are red is no match for wildfires, no match for hurricanes and flooding. As weather patterns and temperatures get more and more extreme, the extremely hot and extremely cold days end up driving the most significant peaks that utilities have to manage.

[00:17:41]
Air conditioners can account for up to half of the electricity being used in the country. The first thing that happens when you have a hot day is people use their air conditioners.

[00:17:50]
And the increase in the abundance of air conditioning throughout the country certainly means that more people can turn on air conditioning at all at about the same time.

[00:17:59]
That's right. America is using way more air conditioning than its grid can handle. And I know that for a fact. Offices in this country are so cold you could store Korona vaccines in your desk. And thanks to the extreme temperatures that climate change creates, this problem is only going to get worse. And maybe you're not worried. Maybe you're thinking, oh, eventually climate change is going to get so bad that I'll be stuck between a wildfire and a blizzard creating the perfect temperature.

[00:18:24]
But on the off chance that that doesn't happen, America needs to find alternative methods of climate control like I know I do, that, you know, when I'm cold, I just turn on Bridgton, all those accents, the cool Gene Page's smoulder, I'm hot already, OK, but it's not just nature that's putting the electric grid at risk.

[00:18:50]
It's also technology of all the critical components of the U.S. infrastructure. The power grid is one of the most vulnerable to cyber attack.

[00:18:58]
Imagine if the critical infrastructure we rely on every single day simply shut down power plants, banking systems, air traffic.

[00:19:07]
Control subways, all are vulnerable. Russian government hackers are actively trying to penetrate the grid to carry out potential attacks.

[00:19:16]
They are already in the grid. The Russians are in the Chinese or the Iranians may be on the verge of getting here.

[00:19:25]
Ironically, it's our less sophisticated electric providers who may have an edge here. Rural co-ops account for forty two million people. None of these co-ops relies on the Internet for the distribution of power.

[00:19:39]
That's right, people. Sometimes the less fancy something is, the more you can count on. It's like Danny DeVito. That's why when everyone is messing around with this Spotify playlists on the iPhone Twelve's, I'm jamming out to CDs on my old reliable Discman.

[00:19:56]
It spin it spin. It spans.

[00:19:59]
But those rural providers aside, America is in real trouble here. If America's electricity is hacked, that could mean hospitals lose power, the banking system collapses. Boeing planes fall out of the sky even more than they already do. And there are so many countries already in America's grid that they're probably just arguing over who will actually get to cause the blackouts. What are you doing? Get out of here. We want were here first. Get out of here.

[00:20:24]
You already did an election. Give us something, huh? In fact, you know what they need to do? They need to update the Geneva Conventions for this new kind of warfare. They've got to be like, OK, look, we can bomb each other as much as we want, but can we agree? No cutting power when there's a new one division that's a war crime. So this is a scary future that the world is facing. But the good news is the United States now has the space force.

[00:20:52]
I mean, they won't be able to protect the power grid, but if it does go down, someone in space can look down on earth and be like, yo, it looks like the lights are out down there, everything's off.

[00:21:04]
And that, my friends, is huge. Now, luckily, hackers haven't done any major damage to America's power grid yet, but wait till you hear what has one of the biggest threats to the US power grid isn't state actors are natural disasters.

[00:21:21]
It's that little gray mammal invading your bird feeder. In fact, it's difficult to know the severity of our squirrel sabotage problem because it happens so frequently, utility industry groups say, to the most common cause of grid trouble, they cause one of every five outages. One ill fated squirrel could knock out power for thousands of customers or trip up whole financial markets. Squirrels have short circuited Nasdaq not once but twice from the same city in Connecticut.

[00:21:49]
Well, well, well. Turns out squirrels have been sabotaging us and we shouldn't be surprised.

[00:21:56]
I mean, have you ever seen a squirrel? They always look like they're plotting some shit. And I guess it turns out if squirrels were the real threat all along, some of us need to start apologizing to our dogs because it turns out they were good boys, very good boys. So, yes, when you look at the state of America's electric grid, it is not a pretty picture. It's under threat from climate change, from hackers and even jumped up rats.

[00:22:23]
Honestly, just thinking about how the entire country could be shut down in an instant is starting to stress me out. In fact, I'm getting so stressed, I think I'm just going to take a moment to listen to some of my relaxing tunes. Yeah, yeah. All right.

[00:22:41]
When we come back, NBA legend Kevin Garnett joins me on the show.

Earlier today, I spoke with NBA champion and 15 time All-Star Kevin Garnett. We talked about his Hall of Fame, career, life before and after basketball and where to from here. Kevin Garnett, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:24:09]
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Yeah, man is too dope to have you. First thing's first like why? Why is it so dark? What's going on over there? You know what? We're not in the studio. I like lighting myself, I don't like the regulation of light hitting me.

[00:24:26]
I was trying to tell the producers I got a high level of melanin. So you just got to deal with some of the stuff.

[00:24:32]
So I'm bring some balance to the whole Trubridge show today.

[00:24:36]
All right. All right. I feel it. I feel that we've got like we've got we've got we've got an ebb and flow going here. OK, I like that. I like my welcome to the show. Either way I can see you, I can feel your presence. And before we get into the book, let me say, first of all, congratulations on making it into the NBA Hall of Fame. And man, you did it in style as well because you're a first ballot Hall of Famer.

[00:24:56]
That's pretty amazing. How does it feel?

[00:24:58]
It feels amazing, you know, as you would know, putting putting all your time and effort into a craft and believing in yourself and wanting to grow a passion that's within you is not ideal in a in a black home, thinking big, dreaming big, all those things going to having the best imagination and chasing the dream only to find yourself in your dream and now you're in it. Now what do you do. So to be able to be able to reach heights, reach dreams.

[00:25:34]
I couldn't this I couldn't, I wrote this I couldn't came up with this in my wildest imagination.

[00:25:40]
Your your induction into the Hall of Fame comes with a bittersweet story to it because you inducted along your peer and your friend Kobe Bryant's know now he was a fellow giant in the sport. And one thing I've really always wondered about is how you could be friends with somebody when you guys wanted to kill each other on the court because you would watch the games, you know, when it was Celtics, Lakers. It's just like it's just like, God, I want to kill you.

[00:26:07]
And it's like you guys are friends off the court. Did that ever spill over when you have a two friendly on the court or a too aggressive in life? No, I think Copano had a great balance of respect for each other. I think when you hit the floor as gladiators, you have a respect but within the lines. But it's free game, you know, it's all about advantage. And you're trying to look for their advantage every minute, every second of the game.

[00:26:34]
And when you come off the court, it's a lot less intense, a lot more intimate. The conversations are obviously long running and in depth. But when you between the lines, there are no rules, only respect. And if you don't have respect, then it goes another way. But I think Kobana had a great understanding of each other. I met him when he was when he was very young. We started off when we were very young relationship.

[00:27:00]
And we and we and we kept that throughout our whole times in the league. So it's only right that we go in the hall together.

[00:27:05]
Yeah. It's been an amazing journey that you've been on. And I feel like you one of those people where every time I learn more about you, I like you more. Know, obviously I loved you as a basketball player because I was like, is killing the game, you know? And then in uncut gems, I was like, man, this is a new set of CGY. I never thought I would see. But now we get to live your life with you because you've released a memoir that's coming out this week, CGG A to Z to an uncensored encyclopedia of life, basketball and everything in between.

[00:27:37]
And you've literally written it like an encyclopedia. The book goes A, B, C, D all the way to Z. Talk me through why you decided to write a book like that, because, I mean, that's not how everyone writes a memoir. I'm not a memoir guy.

[00:27:49]
I'm more of a mathematician, a Mausi someone, the history of the world, geography.

[00:27:55]
You know, I'm not a you know, when I read a bunch of papers I skimmed through, I'm not always seen to be the A and, you know, I'm asking, you know, and I wanted the book to be able to be followed very easily.

[00:28:07]
I sometimes when I read stuff, I get lost in how the format, the paragraphs are really in depth. So I want to be able to write something that was easy to follow and, you know, something that you can enjoy.

[00:28:20]
It is enjoyable because you have lived a life. Everything in your in your book gives us insights into something. You know, if people love you on the court, there's parts about CGY on the court, there's parts of it like just where you learn things about who you are as a person like you. You, for instance, you have like you're a very serious player, but you love messing with people. You know, one of my favorite things you did and I never used to understand this because I only learned about basketball maybe like seven years ago, is I I would always see you hitting the ball away when people would shoot after the timeout has been called.

[00:28:52]
And I was always like, oh, do they get the point? And people like not Hajee just doesn't. It's like, why is he doing that? I was like, I don't know. But now we know it was because you were trying to mess with people who are trying to get their rhythm going.

[00:29:02]
It's it's a combination of things like confidence in on this level. When you play with guys in the league, only thing they need to see is the ball go through a couple of times or even one time. Reggie Miller, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, guys. Who are the guys who can actually beat you by just a blink of an eye, have that switch. And I used to be mindful of this switch and when guys would try to be shooting, have themselves a bad shooting.

[00:29:29]
Nice. I would I would just part of his being an asshole to be so kind of, you know, poking a little bit.

[00:29:38]
But a lot of it was just a throw off rhythm. And to really make someone really look like, no, stop doing that. And that's, you know, the more I can mess between, the more I saw it affected, the more I would probably do it. But yeah, it was effective. Yeah.

[00:29:51]
Man, you might call yourself a bit of an asshole at times, but man, there are parts of this book that show us how complicated and dynamic you as a person. You know, I really appreciated how you talked about struggling with attention deficit disorder, how you struggled living with dyslexia and learning how to learn without that or with that impediments in your life, it seems like something a lot of people wouldn't share, especially self-doubt. When people think of Kevin Garnett, we don't necessarily ever think of self doubt being in a sentence with your name.

[00:30:19]
Why do you think it was so important for you to share that with people and say, hey, these are the things that CGY has struggled with off the court job?

[00:30:26]
I want to give people confidence. I want to be able to say it's OK to have elements in the world of human. Everyone's not perfect. We all have flaws. Growing up, I didn't necessarily know what was going on. I didn't know why things appeared the way they were and why I was processing the way I was. So in this whole book, I want to be able to have the reader to be able to grab some solution from from what I from some of the things I was talking about that douchy speak on.

[00:30:53]
Is this the same doubt that Viju same about pushes you every day writing the message in that and having these ads or these deficits is to continue to push through. I never let any of this hold me back. I figured it out. It was an odd way to figure some of this stuff out, but it worked at the end, the date and the message. She has to continue to push through, no matter whatever it is, this is a solution to everything.

[00:31:19]
And I really like to believe that. So I want to share that with everybody to show the human side of me to, you know, people she race in this great athlete and you running and jumping in all this. And they don't really understand that. You know, it's a whole bunch of other things that go into the makeup of a person. So I want to show more human side of him.

[00:31:38]
And the book takes us into all the things that go into the makeup of this human in particular, one of the scariest stories to read in the book, because it just shows how much a person's life could change in an instant is when you talk about being in high school and getting into a fight defending your friend who is getting beaten up by these white kids, the next thing you know you will being put up for lynching charges, which is a capital offense where you were in South Carolina.

[00:32:05]
I mean, this is this is a scary world for you to be in when you think to yourself that one thing could have changed your life and there might be no Kevin Garnett in the Hall of Fame right now expects and this where the same bad association sports useful habits come into play.

[00:32:23]
And I was a young kid at the time and I'm a very loyal person. People know me for that. And, you know, you get yourself in situations and you don't really think when you're young, you just more react, you know, going through that situation. It taught me to actually think before actually responding or actually reacting to things. I was very fortunate to be able to go through that process and come out of it and find a rainbow at the end, if you will.

[00:32:51]
I took a negative. I took myself and I was completely invested in whatever the consequences was. And I went through that process and I came out on top. And I like to think that it made me a better person. I like to think that it made me shrink my my so-called circle of friends, too. It made me rethink a lot of things that were going on in my life as a young individual. And I can I can honestly say that was a pivotal point in my life to where a lot of things changed for me, along with my attitude to things.

[00:33:25]
I feel I feel that I mean, I could relate to the parts of the book where I read when I went, man, just one mistake as a kid can change your life depending on how you get punished for that mistake. So many people don't get punished. And the people who do it like that was it that was the mistake that changed your life forever. And I don't want to spoil parts of the book, so I want people to read it and just really appreciate that story.

[00:33:44]

For all you foodies out there, I'm unwrapping a McDonald's steak, egg and cheese bagel. Look at this steak and the juice running down the side. Got a little bit on the wrapper here. And then a fluffy egg and real cheese floated over the side, looking just so good. Mm hmm. Grilled onions on about a bagel. Two thumbs up from McDonald's steak, egg and cheese bagel for breakfast. Love it.
