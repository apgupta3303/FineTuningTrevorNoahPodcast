Hey, what's going on, everybody? I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is February twenty fourth, which means it's the last week of Black History Month. And that is why, once again, my friends, I've decided to make new black history by becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball. What what do you mean that's been done? Hundreds of. What are you talking about? Well, I don't watch.

[00:01:30]
It's boring. Why would I watch it? Anyway, on tonight's show, we look at why black people aren't getting vaccinated. Dorsay Sloane tells you why Oprah is weak. And we meet the dog that's going to put all of us in prison. So let's do this, people.

[00:01:43]
Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with children all year.

[00:01:58]
Let's kick things off with an update on the January 6th insurrection at the capital, the day white supremacist entered the capital without having to get elected. Yesterday, Congress held its first hearings on what went wrong with security that day.

[00:02:13]
And the testimony from the people in charge was not encouraging former Capitol Hill security officials and the acting chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police. We're counting the January 6th insurrection, highlighting major communication failures that led to the deadly riots the day before the insurrection. An FBI memo explicitly warning about the possibility of violence was sent via email but never made its way to leadership.

[00:02:38]
Here's the intelligence. Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking doors being kicked in and blood from their blood and teeth. A slave soldier is being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march or a rally or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our president or we die.

[00:02:55]
I would certainly say that something as violent as insurrection, capital or a phone call or something.

[00:03:03]
Yeah, man, I agree with this. In fact, this was the first time in history an email should have been a meeting. Email is the least effective way to get an emergency message to anybody.

[00:03:15]
It goes text Dem message in a bottle that you throw into the ocean and then email. And if it's really not important phone call. I mean, this was an attempted overthrow of the government. It's kind of important that they hear about it. I'm just saying, like, if it was me, I would have sent an edible arrangements. You know how I know email isn't an effective way to get someone's attention? Because whenever you send an email, what do you have to do immediately after that?

[00:03:41]
You have to send a text asking, did you get my email? The problem with email is that we just get so many. You know, it's easy to miss the one that says insurrection at the capital know because it might be below another email with three Sirene emojis like last chance for 10 percent of colored contact lenses.

[00:03:57]
And I mean, I know which one's getting my attention, ladies.

[00:04:02]
But yesterday's hearing was just the beginning of a long process. I mean, President Trump incited a mob that stormed the Capitol chanting Hang Mike Pence. That's something that was super upsetting to everyone. Well, almost everyone.

[00:04:18]
Former Vice President Mike Pence is standing by his former boss. That's right. Pence told a group of conservative lawmakers yesterday he maintains a close personal friendship with the former president.

[00:04:31]
This is significant because of what happened on January six and pro Trump demonstrators coming into the Capitol looking for Mike Pence and Donald Trump tweeting about attacking Mike Pence even during the capital riot. But he did not express, I'm told, any ill will towards the former president. Banks told me I got the sense they speak often and maintain the same personal friendship and relationship now that they have for four years staying loyal after he sent a mob to kill you.

[00:05:00]
Man, that shows how committed Mike Pence is to his principles. He won't even bought a friendship. And I don't know where the line is between forgiving and being a doormat. But Mike Pence crossed it a long time ago. I mean, yeah, the Bible says to turn the other cheek, but at the same time, one of the Ten Commandments is, thou shalt not be a bitch ass. I guess at this point, there's nothing that Trump can do to Mike Pence that would make Pence turn on him.

[00:05:24]
They basically have the same relationship that we have with our Alexa. Alexa, I hate you. I wish you would die. I'm sorry you feel that way. Is there anything else I could help you with? And finally, an update on policing in America. One of the big problems is that police are too often called into situations where they should actually be the last resort. So many activists have said that we should find alternatives to cops as first responders, you know, maybe health care professionals or community members.

[00:05:53]
And now the NYPD is saying, all right, I hear you.

[00:05:56]
But what about robot dogs?

[00:06:00]
Did you dog the newest member of the NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit? Yes, a robot dog that's hounding city streets, assisting its handlers and saving lives and protecting New York's finest. Did you dog took its first steps here in the Wakefield section of the Bronx today. The four legged robot was reportedly responding to a home invasion, climbing the stairs of an apartment here on W.

[00:06:21]
Two hundred and twenty seven, Street allows the NYPD to have eyes and ears and also talk to individuals in life threatening situations. This allows them to use the least amount of force necessary to resolve that situation while a robot dog.

[00:06:42]
What a cool way for the police to say they have too much money and should be defunded. And this robot dog comes with tons of features. It's got cameras, it's got a microphone. It's even got an extra knife that it can plant on an unarmed body, all sorts of things. But you've got to give props to the police for how they're marketing this robot. Oh, look at our adorable dog. No, it's a cop made out of steel.

[00:07:09]
Like they can call tear gas Potti smoke doesn't mean it's going to sting any less when they blast you with it. It will be funny, though, to see how people try to bribe a robot police dog.

[00:07:18]
Listen, Officer, how about we left this ticket slide and I give you 10 minutes with my laser printer? No questions there.

[00:07:26]
And look, I'm not saying robot dogs won't ever be useful. I mean, they'd be great to send into a hostage situation.

[00:07:33]
I want a million dollars and a helicopter to get me out of here. You hear me?

[00:07:38]
You got rough. Rough what? What do you want? No, I'm not taking you out. I'm doing a hostage thing. OK, fine. I'll take you to the end of the block and back. OK, you got that. All right. Good boy. Come on. Come on, boy. Look at you. But let's move on now to our main story, the coronavirus vaccine. It's the reason your grandma is now face timing you from a crowded bar.

[00:08:06]
Today brings some really good news. The FDA announced that a new vaccine from Johnson and Johnson has been proven effective, including against the coronavirus variants, and could be hitting the streets this weekend. Plus, unlike the Madonna and Pfizer vaccines, it works with one dose and doesn't need to be kept in freezers. So this vaccine is basically as low maintenance as you pretend to be on your first date. And with vaccine availability improving, more and more people are able to get their shots.

[00:08:34]
And experts actually say that America will soon be giving out nearly two million doses a day. So with three hundred and thirty million Americans two million doses a day, that means the pandemic will be over in. Six, but this is still America, which means not everyone is getting access to the vaccines equally a big gap.

[00:09:00]
And who gets the coronavirus vaccine in the US? Information from twenty three states that report covid vaccinations by race and ethnicity shows a stark difference in the role of black Americans are hospitalized for coveted almost triple the rate and are at least one point five times more likely to die from this virus than white Americans. But just over five percent of Americans vaccinated are black versus more than 60 percent who are white.

[00:09:28]
Cities like Philadelphia and Chicago with a black population double or triple the percent receiving covid vaccine.

[00:09:35]
Unfortunately, in New York City, we learned that we had managed to vaccinate more non New York City residents here in New York City than we had vaccinated black, Hispanic and Native American New Yorkers combined.

[00:09:49]
Well, well, well, if it isn't my old arch nemesis, racism, what are you doing here? What's that? Oh, you pretty much everywhere, you know, it's it's a fair point, but this is crazy people according to the available data. New York has vaccinated more out of towners, then minorities who actually live here in New York. I mean, they need to beef up the screening process, like before giving someone a shot. Just ask them to walk six feet on a sidewalk.

[00:10:18]
And then if they stop and look up at a building to admire it, you send their ass back to Connecticut. And this isn't just a New York problem. This is an America problem. Since black people are getting sick at a higher rate, they should be getting vaccinated at a higher rate because they need it more. It's the same reason you hand out free condoms on college campuses, not in a lobbying camp. So why are black people falling so far behind?

[00:10:40]
Well, let's find out why in another installment of If You Don't Know Now you know.

[00:10:53]
There are two universal truths to living in America. One, every holiday is a mattress sale in disguise, and two, the wealthier you are, the easier it is to access life's necessities.

[00:11:05]
And unfortunately, that's one big reason why black people are having a hard time getting the vaccine race and can't really determine your access to resources.

[00:11:16]
And that's no different with covid.

[00:11:18]
Studies show more than 30 percent of black adults don't have broadband Internet, leaving many without information online about where and how to get vaccinated.

[00:11:27]
If you don't have great high speed Internet, you don't have a computer, how can you jump in lines to make an appointment?

[00:11:34]
Black residents are significantly more likely than white residents to live more than a mile from the closest vaccination facility. Researchers also found black people are less likely than whites to live near a pharmacy, clinic, hospital or health center that can administer covid-19 vaccines.

[00:11:51]
Over 50 percent of the Chicago black communities where so-called pharmacy deserts, low income neighborhoods where pharmacies are far from the population and people don't have regular access to vehicles, compared with just five percent in white communities.

[00:12:05]
San Francisco's Pharmacy Deserto Zipcode nine four one two four. Ninety two percent of the population is black and Hispanic, and there's only one retail pharmacy for the more than thirty five thousand people who live there.

[00:12:17]
Where do they go if they don't have a personal or primary care physician? And the answer in many cases is there's nowhere to go. That's right.

[00:12:25]
Many black neighborhoods don't even have a pharmacy. There are so few pharmacies that I'm surprised Republicans haven't made them voting locations. And this is especially messed up because in most white neighborhoods, there are pharmacies everywhere. I mean, everywhere. One time I went into a Walgreens that had a CVS inside of it. And it's also crazy how many people still don't even have broadband before America makes vaccination appointments dependent on high speed Internet. Maybe they should find everyone up for high speed Internet.

[00:12:58]
And then a month later, once those people are done going through all the Internet porn, then they can get around to making an appointment. So if you don't have the Internet to schedule an appointment and you don't have a local pharmacy to administer the shot and you don't have transportation to a vaccine distribution center, what do you do? I mean, at that point, you might as well just make the vaccine yourself, which I tried, by the way.

[00:13:21]
But I didn't have any MRN in my house, so I just used the barbecue sauce. I mean, it didn't work, but my blood taste delicious. But for the black community, the barriers to getting vaccinated go way beyond the lack of resources.

[00:13:34]
There's also a psychological barrier.

[00:13:37]
Many black people are just reluctant to get the shot because the truth is they trust the medical community less than they trust the Golden Globes. And that suspicion may seem irrational to outsiders, but trust me, it is grounded in some very real history.

[00:13:53]
There is, especially among the black community, a horrible history of mistreatment that has created distrust in doctors and medicine.

[00:14:00]
African-Americans were experimented on, used essentially to justify the cruelty of slavery creating science.

[00:14:06]
This book, from 1850, one titled The Natural History of Human Species, echoed one of the most prevalent and dangerous beliefs in medicine at the time that black people did not feel pain or anxiety.

[00:14:17]
The federally sanctioned Tuskegee experiments sought to examine the long term effects of syphilis by letting infected black men go untreated with no regard to the suffering it caused.

[00:14:29]
There was also Henrietta Lacks, a mother of five who in nineteen fifty one sought treatment for a tumor. She passed away later that year. Scientists without her consent or her family's knowledge harvested her cells for medical research.

[00:14:42]
The ties between race and medical treatments have lasted hundreds of years and are still alive in medicine. Today, University of Virginia conducted a study of two hundred white medical students in twenty sixteen. Forty percent thought black skin was thicker than white skin. The study also revealed that some doctors think black patients feel less pain.

[00:15:01]
Excuse me. Black people don't feel pain. Well, I guess you've never met a man named Michael Jordan. He's been crying about everything for 10 years. I mean, black people invented the blues. Nobody feels pain like black people except for Adele. That woman has been through some shit. But this is why so many black people are suspicious of the medical community, because that community has betrayed them again and again and again. And you're not going to trust people who have betrayed you that many times unless you're Mike Pence.

[00:15:35]
But unfortunately, this mistrust actually hurts black people because these vaccines are safe. Believe me, on this, white people would never let Martha Stewart get one if it was dangerous. I mean, if something ever happened to her, they would have no idea how much their centerpieces to their napkin holders. It would be chaos. And because this anti vaccine sentiment is hurting the black community, black leaders are now stepping in to try and get the message out through an institution that the community does trust, the church.

[00:16:04]
Black churches have long been a source of guidance and strength for the community it serves. It's the reason why black clergy across the country are teaming up with medical professionals and local officials to educate and encourage people to get the covid-19 vaccine.

[00:16:19]
Dr. Anthony Fauci in a virtual face to face with Baltimore's faith and community leaders. We need your help. Part of a strategy aimed at getting a message in to the black community.

[00:16:29]
On Friday, black pastors from several Boston churches received their first round of the Moderna covid-19 vaccine. We are also here to educate and reassure the minority community the vaccines are safe.

[00:16:40]
Reverend Liz Walker says she preaches about three things truth, love and lowering anxiety.

[00:16:46]
Her focus now is spreading the truth about the vaccine. Half her congregation says they will take it. Some believe God will save them.

[00:16:54]
I always respond that, yes, you should put your trust in God. But remember, God, his doctors.

[00:17:00]
That's right. God uses doctors. I mean, not all doctors.

[00:17:05]
You know, Dr. Phil is the devil's work, but doctors who are actually doctors, well, they're doing the Lord's work and props to people like Dr. Fauci for speaking to black churches and for not doing that thing that white people do when they visit a black church where they stop talking like Martin Luther King Jr.. And I can tell you that we as a people will get to herd immunity. Hey, man, you can just use your normal voice. Oh, thank God.

[00:17:32]
Oh, my voice was killing me. And if you ask me, Black Church is the number one place to reach black people.

[00:17:40]
I mean, the only other place that would make sense is aversives on Instagram and a black barbershop. But that one wouldn't work because then they just get sidetracked debating which vaccine is the greatest of all time. Now, men, listen up. Polio is the greatest vaccine of all time. The hell it is, man. What about mumps? Mumps, man? Don't bring that mumps bullshit into my shop.

[00:18:04]
Look, the point is encouraging vaccinations through the church is a great idea. It's actually something that The Daily Show wants to get behind, which is why we asked Pastor Roy to help us out.

[00:18:16]
Thank you all for logging on to the Lord this morning. It has come to my attention that some of y'all are looking at the Colvert vaccine. The way Jesus looked at you was doing the Last Supper suspicious.

[00:18:29]
Look, I understand that the medical community has done unholy things to black people, but I'm here to tell you to put your trust in the trinity of Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson, because if you get Dorona, Jesus can't put his hands on you. He socialist's it. So I want you to let Jesus and that vaccine into your soul, well, at least to your left shoulder.

[00:18:56]
I don't think they'll hit me.

[00:18:59]
I said, I want you to let Jesus and that vaccine into your soul, helping somebody give me my soldiers.

[00:19:08]
That alone, I want you to baptize yourself in the healing waters of the vaccine.

[00:19:14]
You get your vaccine, get your team, push out the Antichrist and let in the antibodies. You want to bring the vaccine.

[00:19:25]
Might my this I want you vaccine atheist to believe your brother not be led astray by false prophets.

[00:19:38]
Don't bring these guys.

[00:19:43]
Let the vaccination be your salvation from your isolation.

[00:19:47]
Never going back, back, back, back, back, back.

[00:19:57]
Blessed would be immune for they shall inherit the earth from the movie theater to the gym all the way to the promised. The Red Lobster. Oh, yes. Nango whole up, I think we to make the point also, I got to wrap this up, my little boy got a clarinet lesson over Zoome. I only pay for the free 40 minute version. Praise Jesus and God bless Dr. Foushee. And I'll see you next week for the booster shot.

[00:20:36]
Oh, yes, I can feel it. All right. When we come back.

[00:20:40]
Don't say Sloan tells us why black women aren't as strong as you may think. And Andre is joining us as a guest.

[00:20:47]
Don't go away. We think America's finally ready for this, a show by black people, for all people about the black experience in America. It's time to go there. Coming Tuesday night on ABC, Soul of a Nation. All the pain, all the joy. Unafraid, funny, beautiful.

[00:21:07]
And there will be news coming to ABC Tuesday night at 10:00. Nonsense. So some of this is coming and I hope you'll watch Soul of a Nation.

[00:21:18]
I'll be watching The Daily Show, Eres Edition, and the following message is brought to you by American Express, and they're built to last podcast that highlights the story's history and continued legacy of black owned small businesses that shape American culture. In honor of Black History Month, American Express continuing to shine a light on these black owned businesses with the release of a special episode highlighting Rose Nakad, the first known coffee vendor in New Orleans in the Eighteen Hundreds and Sipan Sonder, a community and well-being focused coffee shop in Inglewood, California.

[00:21:49]
If you haven't already, check out the debut season of Built to Last and see host Elaine Welter Roth explore how the black business leaders of our past have inspired today's black owned small businesses. The season features small business owners like Pinki Cole of Atlanta's food truck turned restaurant, slutty vegan Hanifa Muamba, a cutting edge designer and so many other amazing small business owners. Plus a special check in with modern day Renaissance woman ICRA, as built to last uncovers and celebrates past and present stories of black entrepreneurship in America.

[00:22:19]
We hope to encourage all of our listeners to support these businesses and also the black owned businesses in your community. Check out the debut season of Built to Last on Spotify, Apple, YouTube or wherever you get your favorite podcasts.

[00:22:34]
Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show, it's no secret that black women have always had to deal with negative stereotypes. But for Black History Month, Dorsay Sloan looks at a positive stereotype that still has a negative impact. In another episode of DeWall saying. Black women, we gave you Oprah, Beyonce and all your favorite reaction, me, I've heard people say they like their women, like they like their coffee, strong, black and hot enough to give you second degree burns.

[00:23:12]
Careful what you wish for, Dariusz. But the thing is, not all black women are strong and even the ones that are strong aren't just that we like doors open for us, too, especially with someone with biceps like Michael B. Jordan, abs like Michael Jordan, hair like Michael B. Jordan. But unfortunately, the strong black woman stereotype is ingrained in American culture. It has a long history about as old as Morgan Freeman and Betty White combined. Now, you may be wondering, what is a strong black woman?

[00:23:50]
Is the idea that black women are emotionally resilient, naturally selfless, too proud to ask for help and can succeed with no resources? So basically, every character played by Viola Davis, the irony is the strong black woman stereotype was started by black women to come back on the negative ones. See, in the aftermath of slavery, there were really only two stereotypes of black women. You were either some sex temptress Jezebel or a mammy who was just there to smother people in her boobs.

[00:24:21]
In response, black suffragette Mary Church, Terrell Point, the strong black woman model lifting as we climb. And I get what she was going for, but lift as we climb. Even bodybuilders don't do both. At the same time, you can expect the black woman to do more than Schwarzenegger in his prime. But over time, society shrank a black woman down to just her strength. And the popular conception now is that black women can bear and overcome any birth.

[00:24:49]
We see it all over our culture in movies like The Color Purple. All my life I don't fight. And how can we forget Ghost or Whoopi Goldberg literally has to let a white man use her body to rub foreheads with his fiancee. Even when black women only have one line, it's strong as hell or you will be moved. Damn, at least let her say hello. Let's all say what's wrong with being perceived as strong? Isn't it a good thing?

[00:25:18]
No, not if black women destroy their mental and physical health trying to live up to it. And not if people think black women are so strong, they make them do all the work on their own. Look at Stacey Abrams. She helped Democrats win Georgia. And before you knew what she was being asked to fix vaccine distribution, the New York subway and Carmen guys marry. The stereotype even reaches the doctor's office. Black women are less likely to be properly diagnosed.

[00:25:46]
They have a much higher maternal mortality rate and they're less likely to be believed about their symptoms and pain. So a black woman basically has to be a doctor to know everything that's going on with her body and then convince another doctor that that's what's happening. I was in a car accident. I have contusions, lacerations and internal bleeding. Get me a morphine drip and perhaps surgery step.

[00:26:10]
We'll get you a couple of bandaids. You'll be fine. What? So the next time you see a black woman struggling at work or trying to lift the box, help her, don't just stand there like you're about to see Wonder Woman in action. In fact, if you're in the New York area. Now, moving this week and I could use some help moving my couch, because I'll be damned if I'm going to pull my back lift in my own couch.

[00:26:41]
Thank you so much for that to say, I really wish I could help you move, but I'm busy on whatever day that is. All right. When we come back. The multitalented Andre De talks about playing the legendary Billie Holiday.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today I spoke with singer songwriter and actor Andra Day. We talked about the legacy of Billie Holiday and her portrayal of the legend in her new movie that's just gotten her two Golden Globe nominations on today. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.

[00:28:16]
So what it is, isn't it? I enjoy it just as much as the regular Daily Show.

[00:28:22]
So thank you very much. I appreciate that. I really do. And before we get any further, let's start with the congratulations that are in order to Golden Globe nominations, which is huge for your work on the new Billie Holiday movie.

[00:28:37]
And what's really impressive about is not just the nominations. This is your debut acting role. I mean, what a way to start.

[00:28:45]
Yeah, definitely. What a way to start. And it was almost a way to end while I was on set like this. But this might have taken me out. I might have done this. But now I mean, now I'm definitely more balanced and I feel kind of at a healthier place. But yeah, it was I mean, I didn't want to do it at first, but I'm really glad that I did. And I didn't sort of, I guess, self sabotage my way out of it, because it's an honor to be a part of the story and legacy and to help bring the truth about her life to the public by Billie Holiday.

[00:29:18]
People might know as the musician, but what makes this film special is you show us Billie Holiday as the civil rights icon, as this woman who is fighting against a system that is trying to shut her down. Tell me a little bit more about that story and the part of her life that a lot of people really don't know about.

[00:29:34]
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, to put it frankly, is the part of her life that people were never supposed to know about. People need to understand that the reason they know Billie Holiday is this sort of tragic drug addict, but like a great jazz singer is because that was that was the narrative that was fed to us as a people. But what they really need to know is that she was sort of the genesis. She was the great grandmother of civil rights.

[00:29:58]
She's the first martyr in the war on drugs. And she was singing Strange Fruit, a song about lynching in America in defiance of the government. And she was integrated audiences. You know, she was a fighter and doing it all on her own. We did not have civil rights as we would have had if it wasn't for her, her sacrifice. So she's a hero.

[00:30:20]
She's a hero because she went up against arguably the most powerful force in the world at one time and maybe even now the United States government. You know, it's a really scary story.

[00:30:30]
Talk me through your role and what it was like for you to play this woman who on one hand is this amazing icon who's performing and and really enthralling audiences. And on the other hand, a woman who's dealing with her fears or insecurities and the dark world that she is a part of, whether she likes it or not.

[00:30:47]
Yeah, absolutely. And I love that you said that just now, whether she's a part of it or not, because one of the things I always say I hear all the time is that it was a very complicated it was nothing complicated about a black, queer woman trying to live free. It's complicated as the circumstance that she's in the 30s, 40s and 50s. The entire government is using all of their force. And as you said, one of the most powerful forces and one of the most powerful figures and one of probably the most diabolical and divisive.

[00:31:18]
But you know him, Harry Anslinger, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the entire article was singing a song about racial terror and that she lost her father to Jim Crow, that she was raped and punished for being raped by a 40 year old man sent into a brothel, was raised in a brothel, you know, that was pumped into the community. She used that as a way to deal with the trauma of living. So it was nothing complex about her.

[00:31:45]
She was beautiful. She was in very good shape and love her. And it was. Sense of urgency, right, performing this role and singing when I was on your show and when I was doing it in the past, it was to pay the bills and to pay people and to just bring this song into a new era. But on set, it was very different. And it was first time I sang the song and realized this is not a song.

[00:32:13]
This is another song with this song, Bulging Eyes, The Twisted Mouth Burning Flesh. And I had a need for people in the audience to stop enjoying it. I didn't want them clapping. I didn't write. This is not the song. Go do something because I might die to sing this tonight. So it was definitely transformed.

[00:32:33]
You could have taken the easy route in playing the role that you did, but you didn't. I mean, you lost almost, what, 40 pounds to play this role. You also took on some of Billy's vices. You started smoking. You don't smoke. You surrounded yourself with people who are struggling with drugs as well to understand addiction, to start to to sort of understand what she was going through, what was the hardest part of inhabiting that side of Billie Holiday's world?

[00:33:03]
I mean, the hardest part. Listen, it took a toll on my family, right? Because the reality is when you're going through this and you're preparing for it, you're not going through it by yourself. So on my family, on my own, my company staff, on my band, you know, everybody. Yes, studying the addiction lost weight to the drinking and smoking and and all the things as well, too. I don't typically they're not for me.

[00:33:26]
I make personal vow to be abstinent for the last seven, almost seven years. So that's not a sign that I engage in either. And so it was definitely. Challenging, but I think the hardest part when I look back on it now was coming out of it as a normal human being, three years of life and trying to figure out. I am in this season of my life and, wow, really, really difficult, and I remember a moment actually on set, he would ask me, he says, you were doing this on all of me.

[00:33:58]
And he said, throw Billy away. Now just give me and give me. And I tried and I we got it recorded in the movie, of course. But I genuinely was breaking down from what you see in the film in that moment, because I had to look at him and just I felt like I let him down. So I was like, I don't know, sorry.

[00:34:14]
I don't know if I'm supposed to be Tuzman, but that has a way I so I'm trying to get a footing in my life now and think about who I am. But that is great, immense patience. Well, I'll tell you this.

[00:34:31]
You've done an amazing job at telling the story. It's no surprise that you were nominated. I wish you the best of luck. And I can't wait to see what you take on after this is all done and after you've found the new Andrew for the next chapter of your life. Yeah, hopefully she's great.

[00:34:46]
