[00:00:22]

[00:00:46]
Joe Biden, like most old people, wasn't always old. In fact, when he started his political career, he was the fresh face.

[00:00:53]
Biden's Senate career began with him as the fifth youngest senator ever elected at 29. In 1972, he served in the Senate for three decades. Biden's early years in the Senate saw seismic political change at the end of the Vietnam War. The impeachment of Richard Nixon, Biden never moved to Washington, choosing instead to commute home by train each night. He has a nickname of Amtrak Joe. I take this train literally, I take it over 7000 for. Time since I got here, so people don't just love Joe Biden because he's a down to earth everyday man.

[00:01:26]
No, people love him because he's an adorable goofball.

[00:01:30]
In fact, the only thing that spends more time in Biden's mouth than those perfect teeth is his own foot, his biggest possible weakness, his reputation for verbal gaffes, as Barack says, a three letter word, jobs. J. O. B. S job. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent to mine. I'm not joking. His mom lived in Long Island for 10 years or so. God rest her soul.

[00:02:00]
And although she's. Wait, your mom's still.

[00:02:06]
God bless her soul, he said this to a politician in a wheelchair. Stand up, Chuck. Let him see it. Oh, God love you. What am I talking about? I tell you what, you're making everybody else stand up. OK, well, thank you very, very much. I tell you what, stand up for Chuck. That's right. Let's watch this show. Chuck, what he's missing. Everyone else stand up. That's rubbing in.

[00:02:29]
This guy's got no hands. How about a round of applause? Come on. Come on. You know you know, in a weird way, I feel like these gaffes are what made Biden the perfect balance to President Obama.

[00:02:40]
You know, because Obama measured every word like you could feel him thinking as he was talking.

[00:02:51]
But when Biden talks, his brain just clicks. I'm feeling lucky. And the first result comes out of his mouth. That's it. Now, Biden didn't just spend 50 years in Washington going viral. The man has also had some major accomplishments.

[00:03:05]
Biden would enter the race as a foreign policy heavyweight in the Senate. He chaired the Foreign Relations Committee twenty six years ago.

[00:03:13]
Then Senator Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act.

[00:03:16]
He was a key player on guns in the in the 90s with the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban.

[00:03:21]
Biden forced the president's hand on the gay marriage issue, endorsing same sex unions before the president's planned announcement.

[00:03:28]
So for decades, Biden's been involved in issues that matter to Democrats gun control, women's rights, gay marriage. He was even one of the first to support trans rights, although he probably thought he was supporting trains.

[00:03:40]
But that's still very impressive. But anyone who's been around that long is also going to have some baggage. And Biden, oh, man, he's got enough baggage to fill a hole. Amtrak car.

[00:03:51]
Biden is already explaining a decades long record, including his role in passing the now controversial 1994 crime bill, his vote for the Iraq war. Skepticism of Anita Hill and past comments on busing to desegregate schools.

[00:04:07]
Oh, OK. So on the down side, Joe Biden got a lot of things wrong back in the day, but on the upside, he managed to grow his hair back.

[00:04:21]
Look at that, huh? This guy has the Benjamin Button of scalps. Not despite some problematic positions in these posts, many are saying that Democrats are still likely to vote for Joe Biden partly because of how progressive he's become and partly because of how good he is at getting under Trump's skin.

[00:04:41]
The press always asked me, don't I wish I were debating? You know, I wish you were in high school. I could take a behind the gym.

[00:04:48]
That's what I was.

[00:04:49]
Did you see where Biden wants to take me? To the back of the barn, if you want. I'd love that. I'd love that, Mr. Tough Guy.

[00:05:00]
And if we're in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him. That would not last long. Go like this. He's down and he'll never get up, we'll never get. Old man fights. Oh, man, oh, man, fight, so will Joe Biden be the Democrat who gets to take on Trump?

[00:05:26]
Well, we'll have to wait and see, but I'll be honest, part of me hopes that it does happen just so that we get to watch the most entertaining debates of all time.

[00:05:38]
Yesterday, he kicked off his campaign with a rally outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joe Biden at the first rally of his twenty twenty campaign surrounded by labor union supporters in battleground Pennsylvania.

[00:05:50]
The major moral obligation of our time is to restore, rebuild and respect the backbone of America, the middle class. The stock market is roaring, but you don't feel it. I make no apologies. I am a union man. I am a union man.

[00:06:10]
It's a good campaign line and a terrible Marvel superhero. How are we going to stop Thanos? I don't know. But I got Marvel to give us free dental coverage.

[00:06:20]
And although Biden may be zeroing in on one voting block in particular, he's not forgetting the rest of the country.

[00:06:26]
Choose hope over fear, unity over division. We always do better. We act as one America. Donald Trump is only president, is the only president who's decided not to represent the whole country. The president has his base. We need a president who works for all Americans.

[00:06:45]
Yes. That's where America has gotten two candidates now have to promise if they get the job, they'll be the president of the whole country.

[00:06:54]
It's crazy because thanks to Trump, that's not a foregone conclusion anymore. You realize that because he got into the White House and he was like California's sycophantic New York, same to you. All the people who voted for Hillary except maybe Wisconsin. See you Friday, Florida every Friday, Babaei. Donald Trump has become good friends with Mexico, and he's BFF with little Kim. But there's one feud the president is not willing to end, and it's with America's greatest enemy, Sleepy Joe.

[00:07:27]
Well, I heard Biden, who's a loser. I mean, look, Joe never got more than one percent, except Obama took him off the trash heap. And now it looks like he's failing. He looks different than he used to. He acts different than he used to. He's even slower than he used to be. I'd rather run against. I think Biden than anybody. I think he's the weakest mentally. And I like running against people that are weak mentally.

[00:07:51]
I think Joe is the weakest up here. Really.

[00:07:54]
Donald, you want to compete with a mentally weak loser? Well, then maybe you should hold a debate with a mirror.

[00:08:13]
Now, it's no coincidence that Trump is going after the former VP, right, ever since the polls came out showing Biden beating Trump all over the country. Trump is aimed all of his attacks directly at his number one threat. And Joe Biden is loving it because it's setting him up as the presumptive nominee, which is why yesterday in Iowa, he delivered a 40 minute speech that was all about Trump.

[00:08:35]
I don't think the president really gets the gets the basics. He thinks these terrorists are being paid by China, just like Mexico is built in the world. He thinks windmills cause cancer. Look, I think I'm making this up. I know quote, I have complete power. No, you don't. Donald Trump or only I can fix it. Fix yourself first. Donald Trump. OK, that was weird.

[00:09:06]
I feel like Joe Biden turned black by the end of that speech. Only I can fix it. No, fix yourself. Donald Trump, Mike Pence. You better come get your man. The second night of the Democratic debates ended just moments ago. I don't know if it will swallow, but the shocks could just smell blood in the water.

[00:09:28]
All I know is Biden had a target on his back.

[00:09:32]
I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans. That candidate was then Senator Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans. Thirty two years ago, he's still right today. If we're going to solve the issues about a nation, pass the torch. We're going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch, and we're going to solve the issue of student loan debt.

[00:10:02]
Pass the torch if we're going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school. Pass the torch. Vice President, would you like to sing a torch? I'm still hold on that torch. That's right.

[00:10:16]
Biden is not letting go of that torch, even though that torch is really uncomfortable and told Biden that it does not like the way that he's holding onto it. He is holding that torch when they brought up President Obama's record of mass deportations.

[00:10:30]
Joe Biden probably wished that he could have been deported out of this debate.

[00:10:34]
Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations, you were vice president, United States. I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power, your influence in the White House.

[00:10:45]
The president came along and he's the guy that came up with the idea, first time ever of dealing with the dreamers. He put that in the law.

[00:10:53]
I don't hear an answer from the vice president. I'm confused. Mr. Vice President, you want to be president, United States. You need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you, if you're debating Donald Trump, he's not gonna let you off the hook. I was vice president.

[00:11:06]
I am not the president. I keep my recommendation in private. Unlike you. I expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him. That's not what I do.

[00:11:16]
Oh, hold up the Joe Biden just called Bill de Blasio a little snitch. That's that's what he said, right? Yeah, and realized Biden was so true to the streets is like, Mr. Mayor, unlike you, I protect my neck because these bitches ain't loyal. That's what I do.

[00:11:36]
Going into Super Tuesday, the Democratic field had been narrowed down to four main candidates, which is a long way from the original 6000.

[00:11:44]
And as the dust began to settle, it became clear there were two winners and two loses.

[00:11:51]
Elizabeth Warren, one of the night's losers. You see, she failed to pick up a single state. And to add insult to injury in her home state of Massachusetts, she came in third. Yeah, which is pretty rough. It's like if you came home to find your parents had replaced you with another child, just be like, sorry, honey, we'd like Joe Biden to be our daughter.

[00:12:12]
Now, the night belonged to Joe Biden, Super Tuesday for nothing.

[00:12:18]
The former vice president with a massive comeback on the biggest night of the primary so far.

[00:12:23]
A fired up Joe Biden celebrating his historic night, racking up a string of commanding victories, including a clean sweep of states in the south and a stunning win in delegate rich Texas. The press and the pundits declared the campaign did go after the folks of Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Minnesota, A.

[00:12:57]
That's that's a Joe Biden we haven't seen in a while. Look at him smiling full of energy, naming states that actually exist.

[00:13:06]
No, because let's be honest, let's be honest. We were all waiting for him to give a shout out to pencil two since. I'm sure I don't think I've seen Biden this happy since that time Obama taught him how to ride a bike. This has been a while.

[00:13:19]
I mean, the vice presidency, it's America's assistant manager. And today, Joe Biden announced who he's picked to be his VP.

[00:13:33]
We're coming on the air with breaking news. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has made his choice. NBC News has confirmed that Biden has picked California Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate, the first woman of color in history to be chosen for such a position. So the Democratic ticket is Biden Harris. That's right, people. Joe Biden has officially picked Kamala Harris to be his running mate. Say what you want about Joe, but the man went black and he's not going back.

[00:14:02]
And I got to say, I'm impressed that Biden picked Kamala even after she destroyed him at that debate. In fact, part of me thinks he only picked her so that she can just never dust his ass in public again. This isn't a VP pick. It's an insurance policy. And I'm really interested to see what the Trump campaign's line of attack is going to be on COMILLA because they're going to have a tough time. Everything she's done in her career appeals to Trump's base.

[00:14:25]
Crafty Girma spent your whole career locking up criminals and filling up California's jails. She's even friends with cops. All done. That actually sounds pretty cool. Mike, is it too late to change you?

[00:14:42]
Who cares about the last great podcast? I heart really is. Talent scouts are on the hunt for the freshest, funniest and most compelling voices out there, but we need your help. The next great podcast competition finalists are now that we sifted through thousands of incredible entries submitted on the creative platform Tongo from an investigation into high school basketball scandal. Something's afoot in the amateur basketball. How would something as human a sport escape the claws of racism and capitalism to a mother daughter pair who loved to tell outrageous dating stories?

[00:15:12]
That's more than more than I needed to know. Thank you for sharing. Appreciate you for being so OK.

[00:15:42]
Personal growth is challenging, but it doesn't have to be hard. When we lean in to self inquiry and self discovery, we're able to love all the tiny little parts of life, even the pieces we don't want other people to know about. And that's what it's really about, right? Self love, self acceptance, self discovery, excavation expansion. We are the powerful cocreator of our lives. All we need are the tools to get there.

[00:16:13]
I'm Debbie Brown, the host of the Dropping Gems podcast, a podcast about the depth and potential personal growth. No one's journey is the same as the next, but the magic of being human shows up in the things we have in common. Our capacity for love, pain, joy, sadness, togetherness and solitude are things that make us perfectly imperfect. And I want to explore with you how we can live our best through it all. New season of Dropping Gems is available.

[00:16:41]
Now listen. Dropping gems on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you listen to podcasts. The only part of last night that really mattered was Joe Biden's big acceptance speech, and because Donald Trump has spent months trying to portray Biden as a senile old man who can barely string a few words together, the stakes for the speech were especially high. But Biden rose to the occasion.

[00:17:08]
We have a great purpose as a nation to open the doors of opportunity to all Americans, to save our democracy, to be a light to the world once again. For love is more powerful than hate. Hope is more powerful than fear, and light is more powerful and dark. This is our moment. This is our mission. And this is a battle we will win and we'll do it together. I promise you so it's a great honor and humility, I accept this nomination for president of the United States of America.

[00:17:43]
I'm not going to lie watching Biden give the speech was nerve racking, it was like watching the quiet place, one wrong step and the whole thing is over. But honestly, he nailed it. He showed strength. He showed emotion. He made a powerful case for a more united America.

[00:18:00]
And I actually think that Trump did Biden the biggest favor by making it seem like he's incompetent and senile. I mean, the bar has been set super low. As soon as America saw Biden had his jacket on the right way around, they were ready to give him a standing ovation. Biden, speaking in complete sentences, was just the icing on the cake. And last night also reminded us how different these candidates are. I mean, you've got the presidential candidate who's casually quoting Danish philosophers and Irish poets, and then you've got the president whose morning read is the back of a cereal box.

[00:18:30]
You're right, Tony. They are great. Not as great as America, but show great.

[00:18:38]
Let's really sit down and talk about what we learned, you know, take some time to analyze the policy disagreements, think through the important issues, pass the nuances of the question is, is the question left?

[00:18:56]
Would you say you graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class? This is the hunt you got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged. That's not true. What was it to use? Wait a minute. You get the final word? Well, it's hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me. Let me just tell you, there's nothing smart about you, Joe. Forty seven years you've done the worst America has ever had.

[00:19:23]
Oh, snap. These guys were bickering so much. Canada called the cops to complain about the noise. I have never seen a debate like that in my life, to be honest. I've never seen anything like that in my life. Honestly, it seemed less like a presidential debate and more like a fight that you overhear in a booth at Denny's while you shut up, you clown. You got no class. I got no class. You got terrible grades and your sons are cool.

[00:19:51]
Can you present a shit? You don't talk about my son. You listen. Yeah. Hi. Could I get the the moons over my hammy with the orange juice, please? Yeah, that'll be all. Thank you so much.

[00:20:05]
You got drunk and you hit on your own daughter. I wasn't drunk.

[00:20:11]
I mean, some of these insults were way more personal than you ever seen a debate, especially Biden calling Trump a clown. Which guys, I'm sorry, man. That's not fair to Trump, right? Clowns wear with makeup. They have clothes that are too big for them. They're deeply sad even when they don't show it. Does that sound like Donald Trump to you? Now, let's just be clear. The reason that this debate was such a colossal train wreck is because Donald J.

[00:20:36]
Trump was throwing grenades on the tracks and usually in a debate, the moderator is there to prevent things from getting out of hand. But last night's moderator, Chris Wallace, was about as successful at stopping Trump as the popular votes.

[00:20:50]
The country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that well, and him too. Well, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting Obama I get rid of. I'd like we will press president on the moderator of this debate. And I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer. No, sir. It's just I understand you've agreed to the two minutes, so please, I don't have a shirt you made.

[00:21:16]
No, just made a point. But don't answer. And Mr. President, to answer, the second subject is covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it.

[00:21:30]
You're doing it. You're going to have a true gentleman. I hate to raise my voice seems to be why should I be different than the two of you? So you've been talking you made a statement. I'm asking you. I would love to know, sir. I would love to know if you want to switch seats. We could very quickly. We can do that.

[00:21:47]
Oh, man, that is so sad. Trump was being such a child that Chris Wallace actually had to pull the. Do you want to switch seats, move that English teachers use their students. And honestly, I'm glad that Trump didn't take him up on it, because if Trump takes over Wallace's job, then Wallace has to take over Trump's job. And I don't know if he has an intent to kill two hundred thousand people.

[00:22:11]
Now, this is all happening after a chaotic, nerve wracking election night that featured all types of weird moments, predictions flipping left and right, ballots being delivered with a police escort, Steve Kanakis Kalki. But but maybe what's weirdest is that after all of that, the night actually ended up going mostly as everyone expected. You know, Trump jumped ahead early and a lot of states because Republicans mostly voted in person and those votes got counted first.

[00:22:39]
And then as the Democratic mail in ballots came in, Biden jumped ahead, which is what everyone knew might happen for weeks when everyone except the president of the United States, we were winning everything and all of a sudden it was just called off.

[00:22:56]
The results tonight have been phenomenal. And we are getting ready. I mean, literally, we were just all set to get outside and just celebrate something that was so beautiful, so good. We had such a big night. You just take a look at all of these states that we've won tonight, and then you take a look at the kind of margins that we've won. But we won states and all of a sudden I said, what happened to the election?

[00:23:22]
It's off. And we have all these announcers saying, what happened?

[00:23:28]
And then they said, oh, yeah, dude, because first they counted your votes and now they're counting the other guy's votes. I mean, I knew that Trump didn't like science, but I didn't realize he had disavowed numbers. I mean, maybe this explains why he's always in debt. This is just a level of stupidity from Trump that I did not expect. He always exceeds the levels of stupidity. We can go higher. Sometimes it feels like Trump is an actual toddler.

[00:23:50]
First I had a nose, then suddenly my uncle stole it and I had no known what happened, you know, nor folks, I don't have a nose anymore. Although Trump could be playing four dimensional chess here. Yeah, maybe he's laying the groundwork for his legal defense over his taxes. Your Honor, as you can see, I have no idea how our numbers work. Therefore, I cannot be held accountable. Case dismissed, sir. You cannot dismiss your own case.

[00:24:17]
I also don't know how the law works. Double case dismissed. Hashtag winning. But yeah, needless to say, Donald Trump was upset.

[00:24:25]
The more votes got counted, the more Biden pulled ahead of him. And for Donald Trump, they could only be one solution. Stop counting the votes.

[00:24:35]
Something just breaking in the last couple of minutes as well. Things are moving fast and furiously with the president's campaign. The campaign manager, Bill Stepien, announcing that the Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit in the state of Michigan, saying President Trump's campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots in the counting process is guaranteed by Michigan law. We have filed suit today in the Michigan court of claims to halt counting.

[00:25:02]
This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country.

[00:25:09]
We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.

[00:25:16]
This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at four o'clock in the morning and add them to the list.

[00:25:37]
OK, it's it's a very sad it's a very sad moment to me.

[00:25:43]
This is a very sad moment and we will win this. And as far as I'm concerned, we already have one.

[00:25:52]
Wow. I know everyone was expecting it, but still, can we just take a moment to to admit that it is insane that an American president is just demanding that they stop that they stop counting votes while he's ahead? This is a textbook authoritarian move, which is impressive coming from a guy who's never read a textbook. And I got to say, for a guy who hates shithole countries, Trump really likes to jack that style.

[00:26:20]
CNN projects Joseph R. Biden Jr. is elected the forty six president of the United States.

[00:26:26]
There was jubilance as people flooded the streets today, celebrating from the White House to the West Coast, celebrations in the streets in New York City, the tri state and across the world on the streets of the largest cities today, a party.

[00:26:44]
And President Trump's hometown, New York City, Biden supporters shouted out their windows, there were bands and champagne.

[00:26:53]
Costumes in tears, an impromptu dance party broke out.

[00:27:01]
You had Sweet Caroline singalongs and na na na goodbye singalongs. Oh yeah.

[00:27:08]
What a day. What a day. What a day. Now, people were out in the streets dancing. They were partying. People were singing Sweet Caroline, which was genius because any celebration that's singing Sweet Caroline isn't going to get broken up by the cops. For real, though, this was an amazing weekend. It was such a festive atmosphere. The Saturday was amazing. Everyone was so happy.

[00:27:29]
Even coronaviruses like you guys have fun. I'm taking the day off. No, I'm kidding. I'm dreading it now. But yes, that's right, people.

[00:27:36]
This weekend, Joseph Reanna Biden was declared the forty six presidents of the United States.

[00:27:42]
I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did let this of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Wow. I don't know about you guys, but after four years of having to listen to Trump, a normal presidential speech was was almost weird. I was listening to the speech like, wait, so we're not blaming anything on Hillary? Nothing.

[00:28:17]
And let's be honest at this point, I bet even Trump's people want Biden to lower the temperature. I mean, mainly because half of them are running a fever from covid.

[00:28:25]
Still, though, I'm sure that they were happy to hear Biden say let the grim demonization begin to end. Although I do like how Biden didn't say, let's end it, he said, let's begin to end it now, like it'll be too dangerous to just stop demonizing all at once. We've got to stop being mean to each other in this country next week.

[00:28:47]
But for now, what the hell is going on with Mitch McConnell? You see, that shit looks like he's got boloney fingers.

[00:28:53]
But the truth is, Biden was calling for healing and he was promising to work just as hard for the people who didn't vote for him as the people who did. And after these last few years, I think that's a nice sentiments. Although the truth is the country so divided, I don't know how that would work in real life. You know, is Biden really going to try and cater to both because everyone is so far apart? I'm going to listen to Dr.

[00:29:17]
Fauci and then, of course, I will behead him. And to reach across the aisle, I will find my son Hunter and look him up. Am I a good president or what?

[00:29:26]
The point is, people, it's genuinely going to take some time getting used to speeches that sound like speeches. But otherwise, for Biden Harris, it was a flawlessly choreographed evening.

[00:29:37]
Well, except for one moment when a confetti cannon went off and based on the candidate's reactions, it doesn't look like they were expecting it.

[00:29:52]
Cheese, that was terrifying.

[00:29:55]
I don't know about you, but when I saw that the black part of me in the movie theater came out as a get out of Joe, but I don't think, you know, this is actually something I think we need to address as a planet. People we have to stop celebrating with things that sound like gunfire, fireworks, confetti cannons, popping champagne corks, all of it. Half the time. I'm like, who did something good happen or should going down?
