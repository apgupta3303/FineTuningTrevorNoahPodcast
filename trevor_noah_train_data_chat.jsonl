Congress, the only people with a low approval rating than Kuhnen. And then, of course, there's President Trump. He's the big hero in all these Kuhnen stories, so he could just shut this down quickly by saying, guys, none of this is true, Hugh isn't a real person.  And besides, if there was a sex group with all the most important people in the world, you know, I'd try to be in it.  Yeah, that's what he could do. But instead, he has come out and declared that Kuhnen are some very fine people at President Trump's rally in Tampa.  The image was hard to miss the letter. Q on signs and T-shirts.  We are finally putting America first. The Trump campaign even included Kuhnen signs in and out.  President Trump has used his own social media accounts to promote Kuhnen followers and content nearly two hundred times.  President Trump praising supporters of the bizarre Kuhnen conspiracy theory. He told reporters he heard that Kuhnen followers are people who love the country and him.  Well, I don't know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate. But I don't know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. These are people that love our country and they just don't like seeing it as. Part of the theory, it is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals, if I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it.  I'm willing to put myself out there.  Yeah. You see, it doesn't matter that Kuhnen is a dangerous cult and all of their beliefs are complete fiction. President Trump is on board. Trump's approach to Kuhnen is basically the same as the Backstreet Boys song. He doesn't care who you are or where you're from, what you did, as long as you love him. And honestly, people nobody should be surprised that Donald Trump is embracing Kuhnen. Donald Trump was always going to embrace it. The surprise is that he's president.  So that's Kuhnen in a nutshell. It's a violent delusion that spread from the Internet to prey on vulnerable people and infect an entire political party.  Or maybe I'm just saying that to throw you off the real story. The Daily Show Eres Edition in the following message are brought to you by Norton LifeLock Hate doing taxes.

Because you might think it's just 4G but a little bit faster, but it's actually a lot faster. So fast, in fact, that it could change the world.  The new world of 5G technology promises to transform our lives, connecting millions of devices and enabling everything from driverless cars to smart homes up to 20 times faster than the 4G.  Most of us use now five GS lightning fast technology will accelerate and interconnect everything.  To download a two hour film on 3G would take about twenty six hours on 4G. You'd be waiting six minutes and on 5G. You'll be ready to watch your film in just over three and a half seconds and you could download an entire movie in three seconds.  That's going to be fast.  I mean, we'll still spend 45 minutes trying to decide which movie to download, but once we've decided, we'll need to go to bed because we're tired. But tomorrow, three seconds, my friends at five isn't just about download speeds.  It's a game changer for everything. Like with 5G, you can have cities where everything communicates, like doctors can perform surgeries from the other side of the world. Can you imagine a world where your videos never buffa your calls never drop? That would be amazing, except I guess now you could never fake a call dropping with five G.  Yeah, because that excuse is gonna be like, oh, I'm, I'm losing. I'm, you're breaking up. You're not breaking up. We've got five g. We're like, yeah, yeah you're right. Carry on Grandma. Yes, my grandma, Samuel L. Jackson, so. So, look, there's no denying the technology is great, but why do China and the US care so much about who makes it? What's the same reason they care about anything?  The Benjamins, baby.  When the US won the Fauji race earlier this decade, it provided a nearly 100 billion dollar boost to gross domestic product. And the stakes of the 5G race are even higher. If the US wins, it would create an estimated three million jobs and add approximately 500 billion dollars to GDP. That's right.  If America wins the 5G race, that could bring millions of jobs and five hundred billion dollars to the country's GDP. Five hundred billion dollars. You know how hard it is to get five hundred billion dollars like you'd have to marry and divorce Jeff Bezos five times.  And I mean, after the fourth time, he'd probably catch on. He'd be like, I think you don't love me. What, me? Jeff. And the fights about 5G isn't just about money and downloading Avenger's like that, no, it's also about power, because if you control 5G, you have access to everything people are doing online, which is everything. And right now, the best 5G technology is made by a Chinese company called Huawei. And because the Chinese company is Chinese, many governments don't trust how secure it's going to be.  Huawei may be best known to most people for making phones, but it's also a leading player in building the infrastructure for all communications. Critics fear that allowing it to build 5G could enable the Chinese state to spy on or even switch off the flow of data we will all depend on.  Imagine that if Huawei becomes the leading 5G provider in the world than China can spy on everyone, which is terrible because that's what America wants to do.  Yeah, and I know you judging well. If America wants to do it, then how do they just not. That's not the point. All right. You want to do it first? It's like when you cut someone off in traffic and then someone else cuts in front of you like, yeah. So that was my move. But those are the stakes, job, money and power.  And I'm not going to try and bore you with all the technical details.  But while America is developing its own 5G, China's 5G is so far ahead, like they're basically going to set the trends. It's like how back in the day they used to be a fight between DVD and laserdisc. Yeah. And if you're wondering what the hell is laserdisc exactly? Yeah, that's America's 5G. So this is a race many people already saying America has lost.  Luckily, and I can't believe I'm saying this, America is lucky that you have a maniac on your team who's willing to play dirty.  President Trump has signed an executive order banning U.S. companies from using telecom equipment deemed to be a national security threat. And that's a direct shot at China and its tech giant wall.  The US clamp down on the company causes a major domino effect. The UK's biggest mobile network pulling away from its 5G launch, while three of Japan's mobile operators have stopped taking orders or delayed the summer release of a new highway phone. Donald J. Mother effing Trump.  This guy could see America wasn't going to win, so he just got a crowbar and pulled a Tonya Harding on China's five G. Just went in straight there. Yeah, the man might not know what 5G is, but he does know how to mess up other people's shit just in that. And I'm going to be honest with you, I don't actually blame Donald Trump because I don't know how else America can win this race, because even if America does manage to cripple Huawei and China, it's not like America will suddenly have great 5G.  You won't just have 5G overnight's unless America just pretends that it does.  AT&T is putting a fake 5G logo on iPhones and iPads. Now, the company confirming the PC magazine that the new icon is going to show up when users download Apple's latest beta version of iOS twelve point two, but is not really 5G. AT&T just change the name for its 4G, LTE advanced network to five g e. The E stands for evolution.  OK, guys, that's really sad. AT&T is just going to lie and put another stick like it's like you have a smart car and then you just take a Lamborghini on the side of it.  Let's check it out, man. Driving a Lambo now, zero to 60 in four minutes flat.  But seeing as it's a race that might be lost. AT&T might be onto something here because this is considered the new space race. So maybe America can win this race the same way it won the last one. Just fake it, baby.  That's right, pedophile and fake billionaire Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his jail cell after he apparently committed suicide on Saturday morning, which, if you ask me, is some bullshit, right? No, because I wanted Jeffrey Epstein to stay alive for two reasons. One, so that his victims could get their day in court.  And two, I want him to snitch on all his high profile pedophile friends. He's gone, you know what we need, we need that lady from Game of Thrones to wake his ass up. That's what we need. Come on, Jeffrey.  And what makes this whole thing even worse is that we already had questions about his whole pedophile operation. Now we have additional questions about how he died this morning.  The question on many minds, how did Jeffrey Epstein die while in federal custody?  Epstein had been taken off suicide watch and was supposed to have been checked by guards every 30 minutes. But that procedure was not being followed the night before he was found. Sources close to the investigation say Epstein underwent a psychiatric evaluation and they cleared him from suicide watch on or about July 29th, allowing him to return to his cell.  Yeah, they weren't checking in on Epstein and they took him off suicide watch. Why? Like, I'm not an expert on psychology, but if someone tries to commit suicide, I don't think two more weeks of jail would suddenly improve their outlook on life.  Now, you may remember the reason this Jeffrey Epstein case blew up wasn't just because of the magnitude of his crimes, but also because his circle included some high profile individuals, everyone from Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, all the way to famous scientists and even royalty. And because the story involves so many people who are so powerful, many out there wondering if Epstein really suicided himself.  This is a suspected suicide and it just smells fishy to so many people.  The timing is so suspicious. This comes just one day after those documents were unsealed.  I'm not a believer in a conspiracy theory, but I do believe there's lots of suspicious activity to investigate here. Twitter erupted with a number of other conspiracy theories following the news, the shocking news of Epstein's apparent suicide. Hashtags like Trump Bodycount and Clinton Bodycount and Eppstein murder were among the top US trends. Trump retweeted a baseless conspiracy theory tying the Clintons to the death of Jeffrey Epstein. That's right.  I mean, I get everyone else on Twitter, but the president of the United States is also retweeting conspiracy theories that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered by the Clintons.  Yeah, the president did this, which is pretty wild. I mean, because this is the type of moment where you would think the president would be the voice of reason. Instead, Trump is jumping into the fray.  Yeah, you know what he's like, he's he's basically that dead that when a fight breaks out in the Little League game, he runs into the field. But instead of breaking it up, his body slamming the third graders. Can't take that. Take that. Take that because he's doing this.  And you know what Trump needs? Trump needs a fence. That's what he needs. Yeah. One of those secret Instagram accounts that only a close friends, because that's what he needs, then he can use that to just go crazy with these racist stuff, conspiracy theories. But pics, he can just let it all out, get it all out. And America doesn't have to stress. But this time, though, this time it's not just Trump, it seems like everybody thinks that something shady happened here.  People on the rights are saying it was the Clintons who killed Jeffrey. People on the left of saying Trump killed her. Jesse Smalls says it was two white Nigerien guys.  And I don't know, guys, I don't know I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but something weird happened here. Like I was thinking maybe it wasn't Trump or the Clintons, maybe it was America.  This incident should make us all troubled about the jail system. We know that there are many deaths by suicide in jails throughout the country. The Metropolitan Correctional Center has been understaffed, leading to low morale among guards and the two guards in the special housing unit where Epstein was kept. We're both on overtime, one of the guards on his fifth overtime shift of the week.  Sources at the jail tell CBS News they often rely on certain inmates to assist guards in monitoring other inmates due to a lack of manpower.  Yeah, you heard that right. Thanks to overworked staff and underfunded prisons, suicide among inmates is all too common in the United States, with some prisons so understaffed that guards ask other inmates to be on suicide watch for them, which is not ideal. I mean, what if the person they put on suicide watch is a murderer? Huh?  What happens in. Just like so the good news is he didn't kill himself. So look, man, I'll be honest, I get why everybody is suspicious of how this all went down, because you would think a high profile person like Jeffrey Epstein would have eyes on him all the time. But to be honest, I'm also not sure that there's a conspiracy here. Like, if anything, for me, the conspiracy has been taking place over the last 10 years.  First of all, Epstein magically only served 13 months for his crimes. And in that 13 months, he got to leave prison and go to the office six days a week."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about Joe Biden's Inauguration | Stacey Abrams."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Did you see Obama's face. He was so pissed. And I would be to imagine spending two years campaigning all over the country. And then the guy giving you the oath is like, do you swear to uphold the Constitution? I mean, the Constitution. Oh, man. Well, sorry. Let's try again. In four years, you can see Obama's eyes. You can see in his eyes he's thinking, really ASOL. I move all the way from Kenya to have you screwed us up now.  And honestly, I kind of agree. I mean, damn, I know it's an oath, but you're not allowed to say one word wrong. You're becoming a president. I'm summoning a dragon. I mean, Trump didn't know about this one because if he had, he definitely would have gone to Biden's inauguration just so he could mess things up. I, Joseph R. Biden, do solemnly swear. Come on, man. Now, because the oath is required, it's the same for every president.  But the inaugural speech is where each individual president gets to tell you who they are.  Presidents use their inaugural addresses to try and set the tone and lay out the theme for the next four years.  It's a great opportunity to make a great speech and encapsulate his vision in a few telling lines.  The only thing we have to do is to ask not what your country can do for you.  Ask what you can do for your country.  The shortest inaugural speech, a mere one hundred thirty five words, was delivered by George Washington at his second swearing in the longest William Henry Harrison, which ran on for two hours on a cold March day.  Harrison died of pneumonia thirty one days later.  Now, Harrison didn't get pneumonia because he gave a speech in the cold three weeks earlier. But it was still a huge mistake because he was only president for thirty one days and he wasted the first two hours. I mean, he could have been like, no speech. I'm going to enjoy this while it lasts. And then went and spent the whole day just running around the White House in his underwear, because when the two hour speech, you know, he had a ton of plans.  And then in year two, we're going to fix the railways and add some more states. And then year three, oh, boy, year three has going to be my favorite year yet. But you know what surprises me is George Washington. One hundred and thirty five words is not the length of a presidential speech. That's more like a college student that forgot that he had an essay due that day. I mean, on the other hand, one hundred thirty five words is a lot when you have wooden teeth.  Ladies and gentlemen, I at a splinter. All right, I'm out. I'm out. I'm out, I'm out. Now, once the speech is out of the way, the fun parts of Inauguration Day begin the balls, the concerts, the parades. It's basically my super sweet 16 for men in their 70s. But like any big party, there's always the chance that something will go horribly wrong.  Inaugurations follow a very prescribed order. And while most inaugurations have been conducted with decorum, some have had their mishaps. Vice President Andrew Johnson had too much to drink. The night before Abraham Lincoln's second inauguration. Johnson delivered a speech the next day, still drunk, embarrassing the president. An electrical short caused John F. Kennedy's podium to catch fire as Cardinal Richard Cushing gave the invocation at his inauguration in 1873.  Ulysses S. Grant was being inaugurated and it was very cold. So what happened is that the champagne turned into slushies and all these canary's brought in to sing as background noise and they all froze to death.  Andrew Jackson's 1829 bash was the rowdiest 20000 Jackson supporters stormed the White House, pulling down the curtains, working on the furniture, causing massive damage.  The new president reportedly escaped the crush through a window. God damn people think Trump caused chaos. Imagine if his presidency started with the riots. But hey, man, say what you want about Andrew Jackson. That dude could throw a party. I mean, you know, a party is hard core. When the host is like, if I don't get out of here, I'm going to die. It's funny because we think of all these historical figures as being so proper and respectable.  But damn, those parties were ballah. I mean, I've been to some crazy parties, but I've never been to a party that got frozen canary crazy, although I think frozen canaries on the floor can really kill the mood at any party. I was sub girl. I couldn't help but notice you standing here by yourself and I just thought, oh shit, I just stepped up the wall.  Oh man. Oh, no. Oh. Pelton's moans Oh.  Oh, so you got to man what now?  A lot of the talk this year is about how President Trump broke tradition by refusing to show up for Joe Biden's big day, which clearly was a sign of respect. I mean, if there's one thing Donald Trump. Would never want to do is draw attention to himself at somebody else's party, but the truth is that twenty, twenty one isn't the first inauguration day to feature tension between the new president and the outgoing one since Martin Van Buren and Andrew Jackson traveled by carriage in 1837.  It's become tradition for the president to escort the president elect from the White House to the Capitol for the swearing in ceremony.  Historically, some transitions have been, well, ugly. Ulysses S. Grant declined to give Andrew Johnson the ride to the Capitol, and so Johnson declined to attend the inauguration. Nineteen fifty three. Dwight Eisenhower rolled up at the White House to pick up Harry Truman. Truman's were inside with coffee ready. Someone came in and said to Truman, Eisenhower won't get out of his car. He won't come in and have coffee with you.  At the nineteen thirty three inauguration of FDR, Hoover wouldn't look at or even speak to Roosevelt on the car ride over to the swearing in.  Oh, that looks so awkward. Hoover was acting like he was in an Uber pool. Look man, I'm just trying to save three bucks. I'm not here to make a friend. And to be honest, I actually understand where they're coming from because, look, I get that it's important to concede when you lose, but it does feel a little bit like it's rubbing it in to make you give the guy who beat you a ride to the inauguration.  That never happens in any other situation. When you get divorced, you don't expect it to drive your ex to the next wedding. So I can see why some presidents get a little petty. And honestly, I think they could have done worse. I mean, if Trump wanted to be really petty, he wouldn't have skipped town. He would have offered to drive Biden and then show up on a motorcycle. Sorry, Biden, you got to ride, bitch, bitch.  So that's the big public events of Inauguration Day. But there is one final tradition that takes place in private when the new president sits down in the Oval Office for the first time and finds a special note on their desk.  There is a tradition where the president leaves a letter for the incoming president and he leaves it in the desk. And it is that private connection between the two of them. We're now both officially in what is known as the president's club. That's another very new tradition. Goes back to Ronald Reagan, who left a letter for his vice president, George H.W. Bush, that said at the top, don't let the turkeys get you down.  After George H.W. Bush lost his re-election fight to Bill Clinton, the sitting president penned a letter to his opponent saying in part, Your success now is our country's success. I'm rooting hard for you.  That letter former President Obama left for President Trump and part President Obama wrote, We are just temporary occupants of this office that makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties that our forbearers fought and bled for.  While guys, Trump really changed the game on everything, because before him, all the presidents would leave little encouraging notes.  You know, you've got this champ. All of America is rooting for you. But Obama's letter to Trump was trying to teach Trump about America. OK, real quick, there's a thing called democracy. You've got the rule of law. But this is actually one tradition that Donald Trump did continue. And in fact, we actually got our hands on Trump's actual outgoing letter to Joe Biden from our White House insiders. Oh, man, I'm going to miss that guy.  So there you have. It's the American presidential inauguration. Sometimes it's messy, sometimes it's awkward. But even after a month like this one, it always happens. And if you don't know now you know. All right. When we come back, I'll be talking to the woman who many credit with being the person who helped turn Georgia Blue. That's right. Stacey Abrams is joining me on the show.  Don't go away. Who is David Bowie? Well, that depends on who you ask or which records you play. To some, he's Ziggy Stardust. To others, the Thin White do more Major Tom. But who is David Bowie, really? To answer that question will have to go off the record.  My name is Jordan Rontgen. I'm the host of Off the Record, a new music biography podcast from my heart.

Earlier today, I spoke with political leader and activist Stacey Abrams. She's the founder of Fair Fights, the voting rights organization in Georgia that helped Joe Biden win Georgia and Democrats gained control of the US Senate. We talked about that and so much more.  Stacey Abrams, welcome back to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you for having me again. The last time you were on the show, for many Americans, it seemed like everything was lost. We were at the height of the George Floyd protests. Donald Trump was I mean, just Donald Trump and coronavirus was going up in a way that we couldn't have even imagined could get worse.  Speaking to you today, Joe Biden is now officially in the White House. Donald Trump is back playing golf where he was when he was president, but not as president. And coronavirus is still going up. So I guess one out of three right now. Are you happy with how things are going? How are you doing today?  I'm incredibly grateful for where we are in two ways. One, we now have a president who can actually address the death toll that coronavirus is wreaking across the country, can make certain that communities that have been left out of just simply getting basics will suddenly, and I think for the first time, have access to the support and resources they need. I am deeply, deeply grateful that Donald Trump is out of the White House. I'm a little annoyed that he's just south of where I live.  But we're America. He gets to live where he wants. But I think more than anything, we have an opportunity for hope that we haven't had in a very long time. And I'm just pleased that Georgia got to be a part of making it.  So many people have credits to the work that you've done in Georgia. What I've appreciated, though, is how when Georgia flipped, the first thing you did was thank all the other people who made it possible. Walk me through that. Is it very strange for you to be almost like the Iron Man of this thing and then you have to keep telling people, yes, but Spider-Man also helped and so did Black Panther and so did every single other person in the Marvel Universe.  I I'm grateful for the support and the accolades, and I understand just how relieved people feel. And it's important often to identify a focal point. I've been privileged to be a part of building this apparatus over a decade. I've been, you know, pretty good at publicly begging for money for our state and being the hype man for Georgia. And so I appreciate the attention and the recognition, but I do think it's always essential that you recognize all of the component pieces because, you know, grassroots organizing and political organizing are two facets of how you put together the Infinity Stone that actually delivers us from Thanos into justice.  So this I know. And for all the Marvel athletes I know, I completely butchered that a little bit. But you've got what I meant. So, you know, I'm I'm so pleased to be a part of this pantheon that good done. And it is my responsibility to always lift up those who have been doing this work, because the minute we start to believe our own hype, we believe the accolades that they belong solely to us. That's the beginning of someone like a Donald Trump.  That's the beginning of something like the modern day Republican Party where you lose the sense of who you are trying to be, what people say they think you should be.  What do you think it is about black women that are that people see as magic, but black women see is almost a necessity? Because, you know, I look at South Africa's history and obviously you have the likes of Nelson Mandela that everybody knows about. But then you had all of the women like Winnie Mandela, et cetera, who fought for the struggle and didn't get as many accolades. The same thing happened in America. You look at the civil rights movement and how many women have either been erased or overlooked when talking about the story of America achieving democracy.  When you look at the fight that is happening right now, there's no denying that everywhere around the country, black women are at the forefront of trying to get America to be as progressive as possible. What do you think that comes from? That black women tend to bear the brunt of every evil and bear the responsibility for every failure. And so our response, our only response has to be that we're going to push harder, fight longer and recognize that we will go unrecognized.  But that said, I want to expand the conversation a bit because for communities, Latino communities that are languishing in spaces where they are not respected, I think it's something that women do. I think that we have communities, Asian-American, Pacific Islander communities, Native American communities, where women are often the leaders, the loss leaders. We are the ones who do the work. We rarely get the credit, but we understand the consequences. And that's really what drives us.  And certainly black women in this moment deserve every accolade and every plowed it."}]}

That's a whole different type of brutality to black people. So we just go to Japan.  And by the way, when we do leave America, we'll get ourselves there. We don't need you offer a no boat, right?

Hey, what's up, man? You know, with all these protests sweeping across America, people have been comparing this moment to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and much like the nineteen sixties, law enforcement officers have met these calls to end police brutality with even more police brutality across the country.  Peaceful protests have too often devolved into standoffs with heavily armed police using military style tactics.  The flash bangs, tear gas, rubber bullets, helicopters, armored vehicles, law enforcement in riot gear approach a barrier.  Protesters on the other side hands up in the air chanting Don't shoot. But that's exactly what they did, shooting tear gas and rubber bullets. The threat of terrorism after 9/11 convinced many departments to stock up. Now those departments are facing off against their own citizens.  Just take a moment to think about that. The police department got this heavy duty equipment to fight terrorists, that's why they got the equipment post 9/11 and now they're using it against Americans who are exercising their right to protest.  And I'm sorry, what about these people screams terrorist to you, like, maybe I've forgotten my history, but I don't remember the part where al Qaeda attacked America with cardboard signs. And an argument I've heard some people make is that the only reason the police are doing this is because the protesters are looting or being violent. That's what they say. No, they're doing this because the people of violence. But as happens so often, the police story never matches the actual footage because for the past week, the Internet has been full of videos of police officers attacking protesters with no provocation whatsoever.  Caught on camera from coast to coast, alleged excessive force by police officers, attacks against protesters who are demonstrating against police brutality. In New York, police drove a vehicle into a crowd of people protesting there.  In Los Angeles, police swinging batons at people who witnesses say was simply standing with their hands up.  A New York police officer caught on camera pushing a woman who was demonstrating an officer pulling a man's face mask off and spraying him with pepper spray.  This unsettling image of an officer kicking a woman who was maced, caught on camera, a protester run over by an HPD mounted patrol unit at the height of the protest. We as black people deal with this every day. Black and brown people are treated brutally every day.  I don't care who you are. Those images have to be upsetting to watch. Because these images are the antithesis of what America is supposed to stand for. This is supposed to be the country where you have the freedom to say whatever you want, a democracy. All right. You can say whatever you want, whether it's Black Lives Matter or let's all drink bleach. The government is not supposed to physically punish you for that. And that hasn't always been the case in America.  But that is the ideal, right? When people were protesting in Michigan saying that they want to go out, they want to go back to work, they want to get haircuts. They don't care about the coronavirus. They want getting beaten up. And that's what America is, the freedom to protest and the freedom to protest isn't the only American ideal that the police have been trying to suppress lately. It seems like they've been really making a concerted effort to go off to the free press.  More than three hundred journalists have faced press freedom violations across the United States.  The cameras rolling when law enforcement seem to be targeting journalists.  I am press. We identified ourselves as press and they fired tear gas canisters on us point blank range.  This Australian cameraman and reporter were shoved and hit while live on air.  Police now advancing on. Oh, my gosh, I'm getting in Louisville.  Pepper balls, fire at the crew on live TV.  Who were they aiming that at?  Directly at us. Yeah. Those videos of what's happening in America right now, cops are just openly firing tear gas and pepper bullets and everything on journalists. I mean, I can't blame them if I was doing the shit that the police have been doing, I wouldn't want anyone recording it either. So the police are attacking unarmed protesters, defenseless reporters. I mean, at this point, you might be wondering, is there anyone is there anyone non-threatening enough that the police would not get violent with them?  And what we're learning is that the answer is no.  Salt Lake City police officer in full riot gear using his shield to push an elderly man with a cane. The man falls face first onto the ground.  Two officers in Buffalo, New York, pushing a seventy five year old man who falls to the ground, hits his head and starts bleeding. None of the officers in the video appear to help him.  I don't care how many times I see that video, I will never get used to it. Because it's bad enough that these cops push an old man who's walking over to them. But the fact that they walk over him, they walk past him while he's bleeding out on the sidewalk. Like, who are you protecting and serving, if not that old man, and think about it. These were just two that were caught on video now, as usual.  When videos like this come out, the excuse is always the same people always want to defend those police by saying those are just a couple of bad apples. That is not that is not a signifier that that is not representative of the entire police department's. The only issue is that argument falls apart when you see what happened after they pushed this old man to the ground.  A police statement released before the footage was posted online said only that a man tripped and fell.  But after the video surfaced, the police commissioner ordered an internal affairs investigation and the immediate suspension of the officers without pay.  As the officers leave the courthouse, cheers from a crowd of fellow officers and law enforcement in another show of support. All 57 members of the Buffalo Emergency Response Team resigned, but they remain on the police force.  Think about this for a second. Not only did the police department try to cover up what happened. Not only did they try and lie about something that we all saw on camera, but once the truth got out and those cops were punished, the entire team resigned to protest those police being held accountable. In fact, they even showed up at the courthouse to cheer them on as they came out. What are you cheering that Buffalo is finally safe from old men walking around in public?  What are you cheering? What are you hearing, the fact that you've come out, the fact that you said it's a scary thing to think about, what are they cheering for? And something I think people need to understand about the police is that in a way, they have the same code that a gang does in that, above all, you are loyal to your crew. That is a culture that is within every police department. And that's the heart of this issue.  If good, police are willing to look the other way or even join in when the bad police abuse their powers, you can make new rules and regulations all you want, but it won't matter. America is not going to be able to fix this problem until we have police whose first priority is protecting and serving the people.  Instead of protecting and serving themselves. In twenty twenty, thousands of people marched in the streets trying to defund the police, which sounds scary, but what does it actually mean?  This really is a an idea to entirely reimagine public safety and rethink how we do it.  It means taking money out of police budgets and using it to fund different types of workers who handle some nine one one calls, kind of like how Batman had to take a pay cut to fund the Justice League.  And in Eugene, Oregon, they're giving it a trial run with a program called Kahootz. What is that like? A crime solving owl is an acronym. It stands for Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Street. OK, so no, I sat down with Kahootz coordinators Tim Black and Ebony Morgan to find out how the little test project has been going.  So I'm guessing you guys started Kahootz a few months ago when everybody was marching in the streets?  No, we've actually been around for more than 30 years.  Wait 30 years. When your organization was created, the fresh prince had me left for Bel Air yet, OK, they've been doing this for a while.  But what exactly are they doing?  What type of nine one one calls do you all typically respond to as a Kahootz agent? Is it Agent Kahuta Hooty?  We respond to non-criminal and nonviolent calls for service that come through the 911 line in our area and we respond with a crisis worker and an EMT instead of law enforcement.  You say that guns are right.  No guns, no tasers, no pepper spray and gun and checks. And then just also a baseball bat.  Why is it that we assume it's going to take a weapon to get somebody up off of you? I hear what you're saying to him. But like, even more cops got mace and they protect them. Build-A-Bear Workshop.  But where other law enforcement officers are utilizing more and more expensive military gear to loosen a little white vans actually save a ton of money compared to the local police's annual budget of 90 million.  Kahootz cost about two million, around two percent of the police budget.  But Kahootz respond to almost 20 percent of emergency calls. So what does a typical Kahootz call look like?  It's really about meeting people where they are and helping them get to a space that may be a little safer. We started talking on the side of the road and it's noisy and you're overwhelmed.  Let's just have a seat in the back of the van and then we'll talk about nothing but kidnap anybody. Not a fake speculator's, get nothing. I do promise people snatch if they get in something. What kind of snatch?  You got granola bars, some water, whatever. We'll have clothes on the van, tents, sleeping bags.  I'm going just be honest. You had me a snacks. I'm a 40 year old man. I'll get a van for some snacks.  But the besides of granola bars, they have one big secret weapon just being chill, using a technique they call de-escalation.  The escalation of the practice where you're encountering somebody who is escalated and you help them get to a desolated space or a little more calm.  So what's the escalator version of pepper spray like Tabasco sauce?  You just flicked it in somebody that, oh, no, I need to be engaged. I show you that I really care about the things that you're saying and finding that way that we can work through this crisis together.  But lately, kahunas have been putting their lives on the line, responding to teret America's angriest and most dangerous demographic.  And we get a lot of calls that are placed to public safety with a certain outcome in mind, those who say racism is a safe place.  All right.  We have a lot of people that, you know, we do encounter situations where folks are calling in, you know, because of racist motivations or, you know, because they have a bias against different socioeconomic circumstances. And in those situations, I think there are two things that we need to do.  One is we need to recognize what it was that triggered that person to make that call and that if they're going to slap the shit out of them or, you know, maybe try and present an opportunity for them to confront a little bit of their white fragility, a little bit of their explicit bias and say that next.  But then also at the other end it with the individual that we called out to respond to. You know, we have an obligation to say, hey, like this, this was unfair. We know that you didn't ask us to be here. We're here now. Is there anything that we can do for you?  So essentially, Karen calls now on one for protection from the homeless person and then y'all pull up and protect the homeless person from care, basically. And then all from Snax. Exactly.  Kahootz is out there helping the homeless and trolling carrots. But I had to see it in action in a and safe way, of course, without leaving my home. You are the cops.  Technically, I can't get a hold of the police, but I would only do so if somebody was unsafe. And I'm not necessarily seeing someone say I'm safe right now.  I was so scared that Martin Luther King Jr. statue across the street has been staring at me. Can I say something to it, please? Well, maybe I'm here to talk with you right now, though. How long has this been going on for you? Every day.  Every day I come down the street and it's just a black guy and he's just staring at me. Where are the cops? Where your gun was, all of his stuff? I don't see a threat.  I got the immediate situation. Do you feel like that? You don't right now. I bet you don't. I bet you know him, you people. What if you walked down a different block? What if you put the statue in a different place?  OK, well, I'm not in charge of statue placement, but I am here to help you have a better day. And if this is going to ruin your day, you don't have to look at it.  Wow, these guys are good. And if Kahootz could do all of this with two million dollars, imagine what they could do with 90.

Now, the following message comes from the real world homecoming, New York now streaming exclusively on Paramount. Plus, this is the true story of the real world coming back almost 30 years later. The original seven roommates that started the reality genre are moving back in together for the new multi episode docu series, The Real World Homecoming. New York joined Becky, Heather, Erik, Kevin, Andre, Julie and Norman and find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real all over again.  The Real World Homecoming, New York, a new multi episode docu series now streaming exclusively on Paramount Plus. March was supposed to be the month for celebrating women's history, but we haven't really been able to focus on that lately because of what's going on in women's presence. You see, a few weeks ago, the murder of Sarah Evrard sparked outrage in England and across the world. And just last week, a gunman in Georgia gunned down seven women who he apparently blamed for his sex addiction.  Now, these tragedies each touched on a wide array of big issues, from police violence to racially motivated hate crimes. But for many women, the only the most extreme manifestation of a problem that they have to deal with every single day.  The top story at this hour, the violence against women and the conversation that it has sparked among women around the world. For many, it can feel like the only way to guarantee your personal safety is to stay at home, lock your doors and never leave.  The World Health Organization says one in three women worldwide have been subjected to physical or sexual violence. And data shows the violence starts alarmingly young around the world.  Six women are killed every hour by men and for women of color, their cases rarely in the headlines on social media. The Post text me when you get home now going viral, women all over the world sharing their stories.  We often are portrayed as paranoid when we call out or when we say like, oh, this is our realities, but really this is what we see and live every day.  I thought I was an overprotective mother, so I was surprised to see millions of women out there, their sisters and mothers and friends asking other women to text them when they get home.  OK, now that that is truly depressing for many women. Every time they leave the house, it's a risk. And this is not something that men experience. Like when the pandemic hit, men were like. So just going outside is dangerous now and women like you added to the list. And that risk of violence is why women are forced to constantly check up on each other to make sure that everyone gets home OK. It's become a normal part of women's routines.  Get home. Brush your teeth. Put on some PJs and then text your friends a picture of you holding today's newspaper to prove that you're still alive. And that sucks for women on multiple levels because sometimes a woman forgets to send the text and accidentally falls asleep. And by the time she wakes up, the sniffer dogs looking for her and find Jessica is trending on Twitter. And the truth is, even if women know they will get home safely, most times they never know, which is the time that they won't.  Because for women, just being out in public means facing a wide array of potential threats from men.  People don't just wake up one day and murder somebody. They are taught from an early age that there is a power difference between men and women and that it is OK to use certain language and behavior. And they progressed from catcalling and groping.  Ninety six percent of women 40 and younger reported being harassed on the street in the past year.  I'm dressed for work. These are my professional clothes. I've been followed home.  I've been stopped. I have met guys, tried to sexually harass me.  I was catcalled probably for the very first time, probably 11 or 12. And you have 30 seconds that young to work out. If I say no to this person, are they going to be okay with that or are they going to start yelling at me?  Yeah, that's a terrifying thing to have to deal with. Women never know what a catcall might lead to, since that person already has the audacity to start shouting at them on the streets. I mean, it's like the guy at the buffet grabbing rice with his bare hands. You that person is clearly capable of anything. This is why so many women wear headphones when they're walking down the street. You think they're all listening to your podcast? Know half of them were just pretending to listen to something.  So when a man cat calls them, they can act like they didn't hear it and the other half would never listen to a podcast anyway. Oh, you talk about sports with a mix of pop culture. Oh, revolutionary.  So women basically have to tiptoe around the outside world like it's the quiet place, which is why they leave the house armed to the teeth in case just in case they get noticed by the monster.  Too many of us have clutched our keys in office in case we need to defend ourselves.  I now have a panic alarm, which is part of my life now on my keys, on my keychain for my car, I have a mini mace.  Camilla Parker packs up bags for her business. She started to give women a layer of safety that fits into a purse.  The self-defense bags have a taser, an alarm and pepper spray.  Every woman, you know, has taken a longer route, has doubled back on herself, has pretended to buy a shop window.  I walk in the middle of the road and I do tell my daughters to do this. That is a safe. God damn, it's safer in the middle of the road, you know, how bad do men have to be for women to be like, oh, I'll take my chances with an 18 wheeler. At least it won't tell me to smile. And I never want to hear anyone talk shit about women's giant purses again, like ever again. Look at all the shit that they have to bring with them just to stay safe.  They've got Tasers, they've got mini mace sprays on their key chains. What do men have on our key chains, huh?  Bottle openers. I mean, that should tell you everything you need to know. Women don't know when they're going to be attacked and men don't know when they're going to be surprised with the tailgate. You've got to be careful, bro. This brewskis around like every corner. But the solution here isn't to load up women with weapons and gadgets like a human Swiss Army knife.  In fact, the solution doesn't really have anything to do with women at all.  The burden has been placed on us to stay safe rather than compelling men to change their behavior.  We are finding these comments on social media. But why was so-and-so going out at night? Why was she on her own? Why was she dressed like that? Why was she alive? She had a drink seeking to blame the woman for the fact that she's been attacked.  The mainstream conversation about the subject uses passive voice all over the place. There's no active agent. Nobody's doing it to them.  They're just experiencing it immediately frames the entire debate as if it's your problem as a woman. We are the culprits, whether we like it or not. This is about men and we have to deal with that fact. And we can't even start to have that debate unless we start to reframe it with men at the center of it.  That's right. The conversation needs to be reframed because this is not about what else women can do. You can't solve violence against women without addressing the men. Committing it would be like trying to address gun violence without restricting access to guns. I mean, that would be so crazy. Like who would be that stupid to think you could stop gun violence without trying to stop access to guns? And I know right now a lot of guys are watching this going, yo, Trevor, I don't know women.  First of all, congratulations. But second of all, understand that there's more to it than that. All right. As men, we often act in ways that we think are totally appropriate because we know that we would never do anything wrong. But understand, the woman doesn't know you. She doesn't know that. Right. So it's easier for you to just not do those things. Like you might think you innocently complimenting a stranger's outfit in a parking lot.  But unless you're Christian Siriano, she doesn't need to hear that from you. We should also be teaching the next generation of men to respect women and be aware of their experiences. And we should start them as early as possible, like as soon as that done nursing their eyes have to be here. But aside from children, we have a responsibility to teach each other like as men. Maybe we should start checking in with our friends, like women do.  Only in our case it'll be a little different. Hey, man, did you make it home safely without harassing any women? All right, great. Good to know I love you. I mean, go backwards.  Look, the point is, as men, we should be steering this conversation to where it belongs centered on us, because this is our responsibility not to be creeps. All right. So let's not make it the one thing that we don't take credit for.

Was there a point when you thought, OK, this is just me now? Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, we went through that. I mean, in my house too, because like the first week, it's like, wow, the saxophone, you know, everyone has to sort of hear and then I mean after like three weeks of playing, it's just like this annoying thing that's in the house.  It's like, when is this going to happen? And then a year later, it still hasn't happened. So, yeah, there was there was a little bit of that. And I also would travel with the saxophone wherever we went. Oh, this was a time when you could get on planes and travel and and so we would go to different places and the saxophone would follow me. And that would be annoying to people as well. But I became a saxophone player.  My final question to you.  If you had a magic lamp, a genie was going to grant you one wish, would you wish for an Oscar or would you wish for a Super Bowl title?  I would say a Super Bowl title. Here's why, because I don't have a chance at that anymore, you know what I mean? Like that people ask me all the time, why do you miss the game and do you miss it? I think when I first left, I would say, no, no, no. And now it's like I miss it to the degree, because all I can think about are the missed opportunities. You know, it's like I didn't get to win the Super Bowl.  I don't get to play in the Super Bowl. You know, that's what that's the dream. That's why you want to play it. That's why you play the game. And so I think I would go with that. You always want what you can no longer have. I think so. So I think that would be the answer.  OK, my wish if I had it would be for everyone to get the vaccine as quickly as possible. But I guess we both have different, different ideas in life and that's what makes us different human beings.  I wish for other people, but you can wish I was your man. Thank you so much for joining me again. My dude was great seeing you. Yeah, you too. I appreciate it, man. And congrats.

Today is February twenty fourth, which means it's the last week of Black History Month. And that is why, once again, my friends, I've decided to make new black history by becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball. What what do you mean that's been done? Hundreds of. What are you talking about? Well, I don't watch.  It's boring. Why would I watch it? Anyway, on tonight's show, we look at why black people aren't getting vaccinated. Dorsay Sloane tells you why Oprah is weak. And we meet the dog that's going to put all of us in prison. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with children all year.  Let's kick things off with an update on the January 6th insurrection at the capital, the day white supremacist entered the capital without having to get elected. Yesterday, Congress held its first hearings on what went wrong with security that day.  And the testimony from the people in charge was not encouraging former Capitol Hill security officials and the acting chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police. We're counting the January 6th insurrection, highlighting major communication failures that led to the deadly riots the day before the insurrection. An FBI memo explicitly warning about the possibility of violence was sent via email but never made its way to leadership.  Here's the intelligence. Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking doors being kicked in and blood from their blood and teeth. A slave soldier is being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march or a rally or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our president or we die.  I would certainly say that something as violent as insurrection, capital or a phone call or something.  Yeah, man, I agree with this. In fact, this was the first time in history an email should have been a meeting. Email is the least effective way to get an emergency message to anybody.  It goes text Dem message in a bottle that you throw into the ocean and then email. And if it's really not important phone call. I mean, this was an attempted overthrow of the government. It's kind of important that they hear about it. I'm just saying, like, if it was me, I would have sent an edible arrangements. You know how I know email isn't an effective way to get someone's attention? Because whenever you send an email, what do you have to do immediately after that?  You have to send a text asking, did you get my email? The problem with email is that we just get so many. You know, it's easy to miss the one that says insurrection at the capital know because it might be below another email with three Sirene emojis like last chance for 10 percent of colored contact lenses.  And I mean, I know which one's getting my attention, ladies.  But yesterday's hearing was just the beginning of a long process. I mean, President Trump incited a mob that stormed the Capitol chanting Hang Mike Pence. That's something that was super upsetting to everyone. Well, almost everyone.  Former Vice President Mike Pence is standing by his former boss. That's right. Pence told a group of conservative lawmakers yesterday he maintains a close personal friendship with the former president.  This is significant because of what happened on January six and pro Trump demonstrators coming into the Capitol looking for Mike Pence and Donald Trump tweeting about attacking Mike Pence even during the capital riot. But he did not express, I'm told, any ill will towards the former president. Banks told me I got the sense they speak often and maintain the same personal friendship and relationship now that they have for four years staying loyal after he sent a mob to kill you.  Man, that shows how committed Mike Pence is to his principles. He won't even bought a friendship. And I don't know where the line is between forgiving and being a doormat. But Mike Pence crossed it a long time ago. I mean, yeah, the Bible says to turn the other cheek, but at the same time, one of the Ten Commandments is, thou shalt not be a bitch ass. I guess at this point, there's nothing that Trump can do to Mike Pence that would make Pence turn on him.  They basically have the same relationship that we have with our Alexa. Alexa, I hate you. I wish you would die. I'm sorry you feel that way. Is there anything else I could help you with? And finally, an update on policing in America. One of the big problems is that police are too often called into situations where they should actually be the last resort. So many activists have said that we should find alternatives to cops as first responders, you know, maybe health care professionals or community members.  And now the NYPD is saying, all right, I hear you.  But what about robot dogs?  Did you dog the newest member of the NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit? Yes, a robot dog that's hounding city streets, assisting its handlers and saving lives and protecting New York's finest. Did you dog took its first steps here in the Wakefield section of the Bronx today. The four legged robot was reportedly responding to a home invasion, climbing the stairs of an apartment here on W.  Two hundred and twenty seven, Street allows the NYPD to have eyes and ears and also talk to individuals in life threatening situations. This allows them to use the least amount of force necessary to resolve that situation while a robot dog.  What a cool way for the police to say they have too much money and should be defunded. And this robot dog comes with tons of features. It's got cameras, it's got a microphone. It's even got an extra knife that it can plant on an unarmed body, all sorts of things. But you've got to give props to the police for how they're marketing this robot. Oh, look at our adorable dog. No, it's a cop made out of steel.  Like they can call tear gas Potti smoke doesn't mean it's going to sting any less when they blast you with it. It will be funny, though, to see how people try to bribe a robot police dog.  Listen, Officer, how about we left this ticket slide and I give you 10 minutes with my laser printer? No questions there.  And look, I'm not saying robot dogs won't ever be useful. I mean, they'd be great to send into a hostage situation.  I want a million dollars and a helicopter to get me out of here. You hear me?  You got rough. Rough what? What do you want? No, I'm not taking you out. I'm doing a hostage thing. OK, fine. I'll take you to the end of the block and back. OK, you got that. All right. Good boy. Come on. Come on, boy. Look at you. But let's move on now to our main story, the coronavirus vaccine. It's the reason your grandma is now face timing you from a crowded bar.  Today brings some really good news. The FDA announced that a new vaccine from Johnson and Johnson has been proven effective, including against the coronavirus variants, and could be hitting the streets this weekend. Plus, unlike the Madonna and Pfizer vaccines, it works with one dose and doesn't need to be kept in freezers. So this vaccine is basically as low maintenance as you pretend to be on your first date. And with vaccine availability improving, more and more people are able to get their shots.  And experts actually say that America will soon be giving out nearly two million doses a day. So with three hundred and thirty million Americans two million doses a day, that means the pandemic will be over in. Six, but this is still America, which means not everyone is getting access to the vaccines equally a big gap.  And who gets the coronavirus vaccine in the US? Information from twenty three states that report covid vaccinations by race and ethnicity shows a stark difference in the role of black Americans are hospitalized for coveted almost triple the rate and are at least one point five times more likely to die from this virus than white Americans. But just over five percent of Americans vaccinated are black versus more than 60 percent who are white.  Cities like Philadelphia and Chicago with a black population double or triple the percent receiving covid vaccine.  Unfortunately, in New York City, we learned that we had managed to vaccinate more non New York City residents here in New York City than we had vaccinated black, Hispanic and Native American New Yorkers combined.  Well, well, well, if it isn't my old arch nemesis, racism, what are you doing here? What's that? Oh, you pretty much everywhere, you know, it's it's a fair point, but this is crazy people according to the available data. New York has vaccinated more out of towners, then minorities who actually live here in New York. I mean, they need to beef up the screening process, like before giving someone a shot. Just ask them to walk six feet on a sidewalk.  And then if they stop and look up at a building to admire it, you send their ass back to Connecticut. And this isn't just a New York problem. This is an America problem. Since black people are getting sick at a higher rate, they should be getting vaccinated at a higher rate because they need it more. It's the same reason you hand out free condoms on college campuses, not in a lobbying camp. So why are black people falling so far behind?  Well, let's find out why in another installment of If You Don't Know Now you know.  There are two universal truths to living in America. One, every holiday is a mattress sale in disguise, and two, the wealthier you are, the easier it is to access life's necessities.  And unfortunately, that's one big reason why black people are having a hard time getting the vaccine race and can't really determine your access to resources.  And that's no different with covid.  Studies show more than 30 percent of black adults don't have broadband Internet, leaving many without information online about where and how to get vaccinated.  If you don't have great high speed Internet, you don't have a computer, how can you jump in lines to make an appointment?  Black residents are significantly more likely than white residents to live more than a mile from the closest vaccination facility. Researchers also found black people are less likely than whites to live near a pharmacy, clinic, hospital or health center that can administer covid-19 vaccines.  Over 50 percent of the Chicago black communities where so-called pharmacy deserts, low income neighborhoods where pharmacies are far from the population and people don't have regular access to vehicles, compared with just five percent in white communities.  San Francisco's Pharmacy Deserto Zipcode nine four one two four. Ninety two percent of the population is black and Hispanic, and there's only one retail pharmacy for the more than thirty five thousand people who live there.  Where do they go if they don't have a personal or primary care physician? And the answer in many cases is there's nowhere to go. That's right.  Many black neighborhoods don't even have a pharmacy. There are so few pharmacies that I'm surprised Republicans haven't made them voting locations. And this is especially messed up because in most white neighborhoods, there are pharmacies everywhere. I mean, everywhere. One time I went into a Walgreens that had a CVS inside of it. And it's also crazy how many people still don't even have broadband before America makes vaccination appointments dependent on high speed Internet. Maybe they should find everyone up for high speed Internet.  And then a month later, once those people are done going through all the Internet porn, then they can get around to making an appointment. So if you don't have the Internet to schedule an appointment and you don't have a local pharmacy to administer the shot and you don't have transportation to a vaccine distribution center, what do you do? I mean, at that point, you might as well just make the vaccine yourself, which I tried, by the way.  But I didn't have any MRN in my house, so I just used the barbecue sauce. I mean, it didn't work, but my blood taste delicious. But for the black community, the barriers to getting vaccinated go way beyond the lack of resources.  There's also a psychological barrier.  Many black people are just reluctant to get the shot because the truth is they trust the medical community less than they trust the Golden Globes. And that suspicion may seem irrational to outsiders, but trust me, it is grounded in some very real history.  There is, especially among the black community, a horrible history of mistreatment that has created distrust in doctors and medicine.  African-Americans were experimented on, used essentially to justify the cruelty of slavery creating science.  This book, from 1850, one titled The Natural History of Human Species, echoed one of the most prevalent and dangerous beliefs in medicine at the time that black people did not feel pain or anxiety.  The federally sanctioned Tuskegee experiments sought to examine the long term effects of syphilis by letting infected black men go untreated with no regard to the suffering it caused.  There was also Henrietta Lacks, a mother of five who in nineteen fifty one sought treatment for a tumor. She passed away later that year. Scientists without her consent or her family's knowledge harvested her cells for medical research.  The ties between race and medical treatments have lasted hundreds of years and are still alive in medicine. Today, University of Virginia conducted a study of two hundred white medical students in twenty sixteen. Forty percent thought black skin was thicker than white skin. The study also revealed that some doctors think black patients feel less pain.  Excuse me. Black people don't feel pain. Well, I guess you've never met a man named Michael Jordan. He's been crying about everything for 10 years. I mean, black people invented the blues. Nobody feels pain like black people except for Adele. That woman has been through some shit. But this is why so many black people are suspicious of the medical community, because that community has betrayed them again and again and again. And you're not going to trust people who have betrayed you that many times unless you're Mike Pence.  But unfortunately, this mistrust actually hurts black people because these vaccines are safe. Believe me, on this, white people would never let Martha Stewart get one if it was dangerous. I mean, if something ever happened to her, they would have no idea how much their centerpieces to their napkin holders. It would be chaos. And because this anti vaccine sentiment is hurting the black community, black leaders are now stepping in to try and get the message out through an institution that the community does trust, the church.  Black churches have long been a source of guidance and strength for the community it serves. It's the reason why black clergy across the country are teaming up with medical professionals and local officials to educate and encourage people to get the covid-19 vaccine.  Dr. Anthony Fauci in a virtual face to face with Baltimore's faith and community leaders. We need your help. Part of a strategy aimed at getting a message in to the black community.  On Friday, black pastors from several Boston churches received their first round of the Moderna covid-19 vaccine. We are also here to educate and reassure the minority community the vaccines are safe.  Reverend Liz Walker says she preaches about three things truth, love and lowering anxiety.  Her focus now is spreading the truth about the vaccine. Half her congregation says they will take it. Some believe God will save them.  I always respond that, yes, you should put your trust in God."}]}

He wanted even more guns at his behest.  Joe Biden jumped the gun a little bit today. He got sworn in at ten minutes to noon. I don't mean to nit pick, but he does say noon according to the law.  That's right. Joe Biden stole 10 minutes of Donald Trump's presidency. Was Fox News calls it 10 gazy. Who knows what Trump could have accomplished in those ten minutes? I mean, maybe that's when he was finally going to release his health care plan. He could have used that time to walk down half a ramp. And do you have any idea how much Fox News Trump could have watched in that ten minutes?  Like ten minutes. So those are the many Joe Biden scandals exposed by the muckraking journalists of conservative media in just his first three weeks in office. And who knows, by this time tomorrow, we could find out that Biden left the toilet seat up or even worse, spoiled the end of one division. And when he does, we'll be there to tell you all about it in another episode of Joe Biden, the worst president in history that we can remember.  All right.

This is the Therapy for Black Girls podcast on the radio app, Apple podcast, or wherever you get your podcast.  Take good care.  Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Dr. Atul Gawande. He's a surgeon and a writer for The New Yorker who is helping vaccine distribution efforts at venues like Fenway Park. We talked about that's his latest reporting on coronavirus and what the outlook is. Dr. Atul Gawande, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show. Great to be here. You will coming to us from Fenway Park, one of the many stadiums and arenas that are going to be used as vaccination sites around the country.  How is the rollout looking? America has been an interesting place where it seemed like everything was going well and then all of a sudden there weren't enough vaccines and then there were too many in some places. What does it look like on the ground right now?  Well, I'm part of a consortium that's been running vaccine operations to scale up Gillette Stadium, Fenway Park, Reggie Lewis track and field here in Roxbury. And those have escalated. We had to start at a few hundred a day. We're past five thousand across all of these sites per day and that will just keep on scaling upward. And so I think that our problem, the distribution will gradually get better and better. The two problems that remain, number one, you point to supply how much can vaccine get pumped out?  It's a big deal that the Johnson and Johnson vaccine vaccine was submitted for consideration by the FDA just last Friday, and that will potentially bring more supply. The other big concern is equity.  We are not getting to the the the people of color and the rural settings, which have had some of the worst rates of of spread and and brought in. Bringing those people in has got to be a high priority.  Now, let's talk a little bit about your article in The New Yorker. You've written for The New Yorker for many years. And now more than ever, people are reading and writing through a different lens. Your most recent article is entitled Don't Tell Me What to Do. And it focuses on a really fiery town hall meeting in a small town in North Dakota. Why did you think it was so important to focus on a fight happening in a small town in North Dakota?  And what do you think that tells us about the larger story about America, its vaccine rollout and social distancing rules and mosques, etc.?  Last November in North Dakota, that was the site of the that was the state with the largest rate of infections, the largest rate of hospitalizations and deaths where deaths were climbing. And Meinert was the hottest of the hot spots in that state.  And so what I want to understand is how does a community in the midst of all of this react?  And the state had resisted having any kind of a mask mandate continued to be battles over the basics. And so this city council had a member. Her name was Carrie Evans, who said, you know what, I'm just sick of it. I'm going to propose a mask, a mask mandate and force it to vote. And what unfolded was this debate, it was really reflected a city, a town wide debate over whether the government could tell me what to do when we aren't willing to do it.  And would that work? They they fought it out. It was closely voted, but they did adopt the mask mandate. And that was only the beginning. People ignored the mask mandate after it was adopted. It didn't have any penalties associated. But then hospital leaders started coming out and saying, our hospital is completely overrun in place after place.  Does a story like this where we're late? Coming to realizing what needs to be done, but in the face of what becomes just a terrifying level of a viral transmission, Harry Evans said it was like steam. You go to the store and you felt like it was the steam. No, there are infected people walking around the store. And that was that was the world they were in, your doctor.  And so that means you are in the world of convincing people that medicine can and will help them. You're also in the world of listening to people's concerns about why they're afraid to participate or not participate in taking on medicine or not. There's a more interesting dynamic conversation happening right now in and around America's schools. Many parents want their kids to go to school. Many teachers are saying we can't go back into the schools unless we're vaccinated. The CDC has come out and said teachers don't need to be vaccinated to be at school with these kids.  Where do people stand? Because it feels like there's so much contradictory information. All the kids, a threat to the teachers are they not can teach us survive without getting a vaccination. What should we be listening to? And what is what is the voice of reason in the room?  Well, in many ways, this is what I was trying to unpack, even in Minot, North Dakota, because I spent a lot of time with the people on the other side of the argument that people said who said and what you hear, whether it's teachers saying they don't want to go back to school because of fear of the virus or others who say, I don't want to fear the virus, get rid of the masks. What you have is a tremendous amount of pain.  I mean, the level of pain that you see in the country, the people I I was talking to said they don't want to wear the mass or the people who are feeling like their jobs are disappearing and they're seeing it happen. They are seeing their kids not being able to go to school. They've seen them lose a whole year of a real robust education. And so I understand where folks are coming from. At the same time, this is the battle.  We have to argue it out. And ultimately, the science is on the side of saying, yes, we can return to the schools, let's bring testing in, and that can help provide reassurance. Yes, we can defeat this virus, but you have to wear the masks. And that means curtailing things like your favorite bar or being out here at Fenway Park. But but we are making our way through it. It is tremendously hard to keep your foot on the pedal for what are going to be months to come.  We are going to slip. We're going to have this battle and debate and it's going to it's just going to continue. And this is the nature of our democratic fight over that.  Yeah, it's going to be a fight. It looks like we're still in the middle of it. And hopefully we're not just in the eye of the storm, but we're emerging from it. Dr. Gawande, thank you so much for taking the time and good luck with your efforts out there at Fenway. Thank you.  The latest issue of The New Yorker with Dr. Gawande. This article is available today. All right. When we come back, we'll talk to a man who went from being jobless to winning the Super Bowl in one season. That's right, folks.

There's exposure one already. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. So earlier today, I spoke with Super Bowl champion and Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Leonard Fournette. We talked about last night's game, his journey to becoming a Super Bowl champion and what's in store for the future. Leonard Fournette. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show. And more importantly, welcome to the Super Bowl Championship.  Thanks for having my guy. How does it feel, man? I mean, like twenty six years old, your first Super Bowl appearance and your first Super Bowl win at the same time. And on top of that, you really played a part in the team. Like I've been a part of winning teams in high school where I did absolutely nothing. And then I got to stand up and just celebrate with the team. But you were actually part of the team winning.  Do you understand the gravity of what has happened to you? What is going on in your head?  I'm just gonna start off this from the beginning of the season for Benkert from the Jacksonville Jaguars. So it was confusing.  You know, I did everything I could to help the organization, also my team, and just become a better man to help my teammates, too. So just from that, from Tom Brady to Devin White reaching out to me and wanting me to join the the books organization that helped him get a ring and I had up and down season, it wasn't the best. That wasn't how to use the big a thousand yards as many times as I want it.  So it was always up and down for me. But when the playoffs came, the playoffs came and I flourish. You know, it's something I could tell my kids.  My grandkids just persevere through whatever I was going through, stay focused first, and now I'm a world champion.  You went from carrying the nickname Playoff, Lenny and I loved your tweets, which was well, I guess now it's going to be a Super Bowl and it's going to be Super Bowl.  And I love that. You know, I love that because of the pure joy and the elation. You know, this has been quite a journey for the team as well. I mean, you got blocked from going to the Super Bowl for the first time. You got stopped by Tom Brady. And then you fast forward to twenty, twenty one. And Tom Brady is there celebrating with you. Tom Brady, who reached out to you personally, was like, I want you to play with me.  What does that journey been like playing with arguably the greatest quarterback of all time?  The journey has been it's been crazy, you know, to see to see why he has the resume. He has. Right. Why he's so respected in the game and his ritual, how he does in order to win games, big games, perform a lot of big lights. I've seen it first hand.  You know, I'm going to back to this guy. We're meet together. He's called me at night. X will, please.  I like what I think about this one or the best protection.  And just to see how he cares about his teammates is amazing, you know, and I see why he's he's considered one of the best in the game.  I would love to know because I don't get the opportunity to talk to many people who have scored a touchdown in a winning game at the Super Bowl. I would love to know when you're running into that ends and when you're running towards it, what is going through your mind? Are you thinking what is your brain just going as? Are your muscles moving without you? What is happening in your brain in that moment?  Well, I can say is just a skill set. We have you know, it's a is a God. It's a God given talent that he gave to me, you know, in a it is everything is in the game, just instincts. You know, you practice so much. Your skills, the drills you do, you work at it so much, it becomes second nature. And again, I see some, you know, hard work, dedication, you know, trying to perfect your craft that I feel you them.  I have I have a similar thing. Sometimes I'll go to the kitchen and I'll open the fridge and I think I'm going to get water and then I get ice cream. And I don't even know how that happened. It's just like an instinct. It's just something inside me that gets me going. Listen, listen.  This is just a bad habit. You could have thirty days, two days. You can break a bad habit, try to drink water, at least one of the.  Let's talk about life now. I mean, this morning must have been surreal for you. You know, the night after a victory and then the morning after, because the morning you wake up and it's like, was that a dream? Is it real? Because there's a moment of silence. I know. I think you know what I'm talking about. There's just a moment. I was like, wait, did any of this actually happen? What was the feeling like with the family?  Because, I mean, it could have been one of two mornings. It could have been like one of those. Keep quiet. Daddy's not in a great mood warnings. You know, everyone just like just give him hugs or I mean, it was jubilation. What that feeling like for the family.  I mean, it was great to have my family come on the field and celebrate with me. Someone as a kid, I always dreamed of playing the Super Bowl, right, and now that they finally happened and my family was that witnessed that score a touchdown, you must play in a Super Bowl.  For them to come on the field and celebrate that with me is no better feeling in that, you know, like you understand.  Like all those things I was going through prior to the season before the season, my family felt that they know how much I love football.  The numbers I put my, my, my. So I dedicate myself to this game."}]}

Hey, what's going on everybody? I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is March twenty fourth, which means we are almost at the end of Women's History Month. So to celebrate, let's once again highlights a random woman from history who deserves it. All right, let's see who we got today.  Oh, look at that today. It's Sophie Ferguson.  What a legend. You see, in 1996, Sophie became the first woman to say, I am the boss when a man asked to speak to her boss. Yeah, that man's head exploded so hard it caused the great San Francisco earthquake. Congratulations, Sophie. Anyway, on tonight's show to say Sloan on America's female catatonics, we talk about how men can help women feel safer in the streets and why Kamala Harris is history's greatest monster. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the daily social distant future with no use of. Let's kick things off with the exciting news from the world of international shipping. You know, it's how you get all of those amazing products that claim to be locally sourced. But now some of those deliveries might be a little delayed overseas.  A major concern for global shipping. A large container ship is blocking the Suez Canal. A technical problem caused a thirteen hundred foot vessel to run aground.  The online monitoring system tanker tracker shows the huge backlog. It's created a traffic jam, basically with ships unable to pass in either direction. They're trying to get tonnes in there to pull it out, but it's so big that they're having a hard time moving in.  OK, I don't know about you, but I didn't even know that this could happen. There's a giant traffic jam of cargo ships. You know, you realize that this is going to set the human trafficking industry back weeks. And I feel so bad for the captain of that ship that got stuck in the canal because, like, we've all been there trying to make a U-turn on a narrow street. But now imagine how much more stressful it must be when you know that if you back up wrong, you might bump Egypt.  Oh, sorry. I also feel bad for the guys behind that ship because it's not like there's a lot of alternate routes they can take. You imagine if you on one of those ships, you're looking at your ways, apelike.  What? Go around Africa. No, no, no. Pull up. Google Maps is crazy. You can't go around Africa. But when you look at how big that ship is, I'm not surprised that it got stuck.  And the crazy thing is that whole ship is just delivering to double A batteries. Yeah, the rest is just extra packaging. What this situation really shows is how even in this age of technology, we still depend on old school things like cargo ships and canals. I mean, think about it right now. We can use our wireless computer phone to buy a hologram with cryptocurrency, but at the same time, big boat got stuck. What a too small.  But let's move on now to Washington, D.C., where there is a big debate going on about gun control. You see, Democrats say that maybe we should do something so that there isn't a mass shooting like every five minutes while Republicans say, come on, where's your sense of adventure? Never know. But maybe Republicans are just busy with more important things, because if you watch conservative media right now, you know that at this moment we are living through one of the biggest scandals in American history.  Vice President Kamala Harris under fire for repeatedly failing to salute the military when boarding Air Force Two. Critics call it disgraceful that she would break the tradition of showing respect.  And guess who appears to not support our men and women in the armed forces? Vice President Kamala Harris simply refusing to salute the military members standing their post.  They should respect the military when they salute, salute back. She's not a very serious person. At least she didn't fall up the staircase here. But certainly the lack of respect here from Kamala Harris, I think is jarring for a lot of folks.  For her to walk by them and not return. Their salute is just it's outrageous. It's outrageous.  Unbelievable that Kamala Harris, vice president and a woman who is one strong gust of wind away from shattering the glass ceiling did not return a salute. This is outrageous and dangerous, my friends, because what if what if Cuba invaded America and the Marines couldn't fight back because they were still waiting for Camilla to return the salute? I tell you who would never do this? My man, Donald Trump. He loved the military so much that he would salute other country's troops.  That's respect, yo. But for real, though, in case you're wondering, there's no actual rule that the vice president or the president are supposed to return a salute. This is just something that Ronald Reagan started like the crack epidemic. And once he started, nobody wanted to be the one to stop. You know, it's like how that one co-worker in your office started giving everyone holiday gifts and now you have to do it, too. Well, you look like an asshole.  Here's your Starbucks gift card, Shiru, or you've got a Starbucks gift card. What a good use of our time.  Now, personally, if I was a politician, I'd be saluting all the time. Yeah, it's fun. It's like giving a little baby, Deb.  Like people, if we're honest, if Kamala Harris doesn't salute, I don't think it's the end of the world. In fact, if anyone is disrespecting the military, it's the people on TV talking about the troops like they're crybabies, make it seem like they're out there crying like, oh, always waiting to salute.  When first President Bush shoots, the Sunnis are saluted for it.  And finally, some technology news out of Utah, the only place where Mitt Romney is considered a renegade. Utah has always been one of the most conservative states in the United States, but now they're taking it to a whole new level.  Utah is a step closer to requiring all cell phones and tablets sold in the state to automatically block pornography after the Republican governor signed legislation yesterday that critics call a significant intrusion of free speech. Governor Spencer Cox said the measure would send an important message about preventing children from accessing explicit online content. The measure won't go into effect unless five other states enact similar laws, a provision that was added to address concerns that it would be difficult to implement.  That's right. Utah's governor knows that porn doesn't belong on phones and tablets. It belongs on laptops like God intended. I mean, sure, it's a little bit harder to take it into the bathroom and try to balance it on the sink, but that's just part of the excitement. Seriously, people, this is pointless. Even if Utah did successfully ban cell phone porn, it wouldn't make any difference. All right. People are horny. If they can't watch porn, they'll find something else on their phone to get the job done.  Well, the Amazon app kind of looks like a penis, and the Instagram app looks like a robot's butthole.  So if I just put them together, that's going to work for me.  That's going to work real good. By the way, I also love that Utah wants five other states to join them. So even Utah's laws are polygamous. But good luck, man. Good luck getting other states to ban porn. I want to hear that sales pitch. Come on. Who else hates looking at naked people, huh? Alaska. You know what I'm talking about, right? I don't think so. Dude, it's pretty lonely up here.  Wow. OK, Idaho. What about you guys? You guys think sex is gross? Am I right? But let's move on now to our main story. March was supposed to be the month for celebrating women's history, but we haven't really been able to focus on that lately because of what's going on in women's presence. You see, a few weeks ago, the murder of Sarah Everett sparked outrage in England and across the world. And just last week, a gunman in Georgia gunned down seven women who he apparently blamed for his sex addiction.  Now, these tragedies each touched on a wide array of big issues, from police violence to racially motivated hate crimes. But for many women, the only the most extreme manifestation of a problem that they have to deal with every single day.  The top story at this hour, the violence against women and the conversation that it has sparked among women around the world. For many, it can feel like the only way to guarantee your personal safety is to stay at home, lock your doors and never leave.  The World Health Organization says one in three women worldwide have been subjected to physical or sexual violence. And data shows the violence starts alarmingly young around the world.  Six women are killed every hour by men and for women of color, their cases rarely in the headlines on social media. The Post text me when you get home now going viral, women all over the world sharing their stories.  We often are portrayed as paranoid when we call out or when we say, Oh, this is our realities, but really this is what we see and live every day.  I thought I was an overprotective mother, so I was surprised to see millions of women out there, their sisters and mothers and friends asking other women to text them when they get home.  OK, now that that is truly depressing for many women. Every time they leave the house, it's a risk. And this is not something that men experience. Like when the pandemic hit, men were like. So just going outside is dangerous now and women are like, you added to the list. And that risk of violence is why women are forced to constantly check up on each other to make sure that everyone gets home OK. It's become a normal part of women's routines.  Get home. Brush your teeth. Put on some PJs and then text your friends a picture of you holding today's newspaper to prove that you're still alive. And that sucks for women on multiple levels because sometimes a woman forgets to send the text and accidentally falls asleep. And by the time she wakes up, the sniffer dogs looking for her and find Jessica is trending on Twitter. And the truth is, even if women know they will get home safely, most times they never know, which is the time that they won't.  Because for women, just being out in public means facing a wide array of potential threats. Many people don't just wake up one day and murder somebody, they are taught from an early age that there is a power difference between men and women and that it is OK to use certain language and behavior, and they progress from catcalling and groping.  Ninety six percent of women 40 and younger reported being harassed on the street in the past year.  I'm dressed for work. These are my professional clothes.  I've been followed home. I've been stopped. I have my guys tried to sexually harass me.  I was catcalled probably for the very first time, probably 11 or 12. And you have 30 seconds that young to work out. If I say no to this person, are they going to be okay with that or are they going to start yelling at me?  Yeah, that's a terrifying thing to have to deal with. Women never know what a catcall might lead to, since that person already has the audacity to start shouting at them on the streets. I mean, it's like the guy at the buffet grabbing rice with his bare hands. You know, that person is clearly capable of anything. This is why so many women wear headphones when they're walking down the street. You think they're all listening to your podcast? Know half of them were just pretending to listen to something.  So when a man cat calls them, they can act like they didn't hear it and the other half would never listen to a podcast anyway. Oh, you talk about sports with a mix of pop culture. Oh, revolutionary.  So women basically have to tiptoe around the outside world like it's the quiet place, which is why they leave the house armed to the teeth in case just in case they get noticed by the monster.  Too many of us have clutched our keys in office in case we need to defend ourselves.  I now have a panic alarm, which is part of my life now on my keys, on my keychain from my car, I have a mini me.  Camilla Parker packs up bags for her business. She started to give women a layer of safety that fits into a purse.  The self-defense bags have a taser and alarm and pepper spray.  Every woman you know, has taken a longer route, has doubled back on herself, has pretended to buy a shop window.  I walk in the middle of the road and I do tell my daughters to do this. That is a safe place.  God damn. It's safer in the middle of the road, you know, how bad do men have to be for women to be like, oh, I'll take my chances with an 18 wheeler at least won't tell me to smile. And I never want to hear anyone talk shit about women's giant purses again, like ever again. Look at all the shit that they have to bring with them just to stay safe. They've got Tasers. They've got many mace sprays on their key chains.  What do men have on our key chains, huh? Bottle openers. I mean, that should tell you everything you need to know. Women don't know when they're going to be attacked and men don't know when they're going to be surprised with the tailgate. You've got to be careful, bro. This brewskis around like every corner. But the solution here isn't to load up women with weapons and gadgets like a human Swiss Army knife.  In fact, the solution doesn't really have anything to do with women at all.  The burden has been placed on us to stay safe rather than compelling men to change their behavior.  We are finding these comments on social media, but why was so and so going out at night? Why was she on her own? Why was she dressed like that? Why was she alive? She had a drink seeking to blame the woman for the fact that she's been attacked.  The mainstream conversation about the subject uses passive voice all over the place. There's no active agent. Nobody's doing it to them. They're just experiencing it.  That immediately frames the entire debate as if it's your problem as a woman. We are the culprits, whether we like it or not. This is about men and we have to deal with that fact. And we can't even start to have that debate unless we start to reframe it with men at the center of it.  That's right. The conversation needs to be reframed because this is not about what else women can do. You can't show violence against women without addressing the men. Committing it would be like trying to address gun violence without restricting access to guns. I mean, that would be so crazy. Like who would be that stupid to think you could stop gun violence without trying to stop access to guns? And I know right now a lot of guys are watching this going, yo, Trevor, I don't know two women.  First of all, congratulations. But second of all, I understand that there's more to it than that. All right. As men, we often act in ways that we think are totally appropriate because we know that we would never do anything wrong."}]}

Today is February twenty fifth, which means it's the last week of Black History Month. And that's why my friends, I have decided for the final time that I am going to make new black history by becoming the first ever black Karyn. Hey, do you have a license for that skateboard you must play? I don't have to wear a mask. I pay taxes.  What an amazing day for people, I think I did pretty well anyway on tonight's show, why your tattoo could come back to haunt you. An explosive story about cats and why the state of America's electric grid will shock you. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Twitter. Noah A.  Folks, it's been a long, long, long week.  The pandemic reached a grim milestone. People in Texas struggle to get clean water. And now someone stole Lady Gaga dogs, which is crazy.  Do you know how hard it is to lure dogs away from someone who dresses in meat? So instead of ending the week on a frown, let's turn that thing upside down with another installment of Ray of Sunshine. One of the worst stories recently has been the crisis in Texas, but even that had a ray of sunshine as a bad situation brought out the best in some people.  In Houston, two strangers took in a delivery driver for five days after she got stranded during the storm. Last week, Chelsea Timmons says she got stuck outside their home while delivering groceries just as the brunt of that storm moved through. The couple trying to get a tow truck, but no one showed up, so they opened up their home to her.  Just come inside, hang out. We'll figure it out. And, you know, at some point we realized that we're probably gonna have a houseguest for a few days, which was fine.  Chelsea made an amazing coconut cake, too, to oh, that is the sweetest, most heartwarming abduction I have ever seen. This is like if the movie Get-Out was made by the Hallmark Channel. And, you know, these days when everyone is so suspicious and distrustful of strangers, it's really wonderful to hear about a couple that didn't hesitate for a second to help a stranger in need. In fact, you know what? I'm going to write them an email.  Dear American friends, I'm a Nigerian prince who has lots of money and you can't help me.  The only person who this isn't a happy story for is the guy who ordered coconuts that never showed up because, I mean, he was shivering in his house like, don't worry, kids, we're going to make it through this just fine.  Oh, man. Just as soon as those coconuts get here, let's move on to a ray of sunshine from Ohio, a story that starts out scary but ends scarily adorable.  An Ohio bomb squad made a surprise discovery, responding to a call about a suspicious bag found outside a church. Well, they weren't met with a ticking but perring coming from the back.  Six newborn kittens and their mother were discovered in a note that says Sprinkles had gone into labor the day earlier. And they're all being cared for. They're all well at the local animal shelter there.  Wow, what a relief that must have been. A bunch of kittens is the best thing you can hope to see when you're expecting to see a bump. I mean, it's like going to your grandpa's funeral, but instead, Beyonce pops out of the casket for a surprise concert. Oh, I mean, it's too bad you didn't get to bury your grandpa, but, hey, we all say in Bagram and Bagram.  So it really is great news that this wasn't a bomb, although after one week with seven cats in your house, you'll wish it had just been a bomb. And look, I know we should be careful, but did this really have to go straight to the bomb squad? I mean, like, it feels like a couple more questions on the nine one one call could have helped. OK, sir, is the bag meowing It is. All right, then.  Those are kittens, sir. Yeah, that's not a bomb. OK, bye bye. Nine one one.  What is your emergency? Mm hmm. Now is the fire. Meowing Yeah, those are kittens, ma'am. Yeah. That's not a fire. OK, then. Bye bye. Nine one one.  What's your emergency? At the same time, though, I will admit it is still too early to let our guard down. I mean, Bomas are really clever people, so this could be a long game. You know, you bring home those sweet kittens, you take care of them, you snuggle them, you listen to them purr, they become part of the family. And then one night, ten years from now, you open your eyes and your cat is on your chest holding a trigger button like boom, bitch.  Yeah. All right, let's move on now from six tiny kittens to one giant sheep and another great animal rescue story from the week rescuers in Australia found a sheep that had close to seventy eight pounds of wool dragging him down.  Look at this guy. He was underweight and all that gargantuan fleece even covered his eyes. The rescuers took him to Edgar's mission Farm Sanctuary. That's where he promptly received a good shearing. Sheep typically have to be shared at least once a year to keep them healthy. Look at all that.  Talk about the socks and the sweaters. Oh, man, I am so happy for that sheep. And he must have been relieved, too. I bet he was like, thank you. My dick looks so much bigger now. That's incredible though. They shaved seventy eight pounds of wool off of one sheep. That's enough to make one million for Bernie Sanders. And finally, here's a young woman whose good attitude turned her embarrassing mishap into Internet clouds.  A trend going around Tick is asking people to share their most regrettable tattoo. And it looks like one poor woman from Kentucky takes the cake.  OK, I'm just going to go ahead and let you guys know that I won. So I got this tattoo I've wanted it for a couple of years. Basically means, like, you know, being true to yourself in real and like not pretending to be something you're not. I got this March 4th twenty twenty and it says courageously and radically refused to wear a mask. She says she's not an a.m. says she was so embarrassed she wore long sleeved clothes all summer long to hide it.  All right.  You've got to feel bad for this woman just trying to make a personal statement and ending up on the wrong side in the culture wars.  I mean, the only way out of this thing is just to go full post Malone and get tattoos everywhere. Just stack them up. Yeah, because good luck picking out an individual message on that guy. He could have his ATM pin somewhere and then we wouldn't know. Nobody would know if this is the problem with getting a tattoo to express a personal statement, like if you're going to get a tattoo, people, there's a simple rule to follow. Just make sure you get a tattoo of something that will never change.  You know, like Mr. Potato Head, no matter what happens, Mr. Potato Head will always be missed. They did what? No, but you know what? Kudos, because she's laughing about it. She's having a good time. And even better news, she just got a primetime show on Fox News. For more on the story, I want to bring in my friend Desi Liddick. Desi, I know you love these kinds of stories as much as I do.  It's such bad luck, right? Yeah, I guess because, I mean, like, what are the chances of getting a tattoo where, like, things change and then all of a sudden that becomes like really controversial.  So it's like, oh, Trever can happen to anybody. Oh, I'm dizzy. I feel like I hit a nerve.  I feel like a hit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? You did hit a nerve. Treb, this lady isn't the only one dealing with this. I also got an inspirational tattoo that became kind of embarrassing this year.  What? Stop the steel wait, you think Trump had the election stolen from him? No, no, I got this in 2010 after a break up, it was to remind myself to stop letting bad relationships steal my precious time. Now, every time I wear short sleeves outside, I get a visit from the FBI.  Well, I mean, I'm really sorry, Daisy, but I guess I guess at least you can just wear long sleeves.  Yeah. Yeah.  It doesn't help with the other one we like. You got another bad tattoo.  OK, but don't don't judge me. All right, please. I promise you what.  This one is small and tasteful on my knuckles. So I.  Cute. Whoa, Desi. What you believe in Kuhnen?  No, Trever I believe in the Q train.  OK, excuse me for supporting public transportation. I mean, how was I supposed to know that it would become the worst letter in the alphabet?  Oh, man. Wow. Wow. All right.  Well, I didn't realize how common this was maybe for the future, just like maybe you shouldn't get tattoos. It's probably safer.  You know, I well, I'm done, except I did just recently get a really special tattoo that you can't misinterpret. It's in Sanskrit on my neck.  Isn't it beautiful? Oh. My sense is rusty, but oh, Daisy, oh no, Daisy, that says Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself. Yeah, I know.  Wait, so you you think, you know what, let's not get into that, let's just. All right. Well well, good luck. Good luck with the tattoos and and life and stuff. This is weirder than I thought it was going to be.  I was thinking about getting a lizard person right on my calf. We should we wish I lost. I lost you, my wife, my wife, my brother. All right. When we come back, we'll figure out why all of America could end up like Texas. And Kevin Garnett is my guest on the show. So stick around.  We think America's finally ready for this, a show by black people, for all people about the black experience in America. It's time to go there. Coming Tuesday night on ABC, Soul of a Nation. All the pain, all the joy. Unafraid, funny, beautiful. And there will be news coming to ABC Tuesday night at 10:00. So some of this is coming and I hope you'll watch Soul of a Nation.  I'll be watching The Daily Show, Eres Edition.

Over the past week, we all watched the chaos unfold when Texases electric grid through the entire state into chaos. It was basically the biggest blackout since Brett Kavanaugh celebrated getting on the Supreme Court. But Texas is far from the only state to experience massive power outages. And the question is, why does America's energy grid have so many problems? Well, let's find out why. And another installment of If You Don't Know Now you know.  We all know how the electric system works, right? You plug your phone in, you unplug it, plug it back in, because it's only at 11 percent, and then you just stand by the wall all day scrolling through Instagram. But what's going on behind that wall might surprise you.  In 1882, on Pearl Street in New York City, Thomas Edison opened the world's first commercial electric grid, lighting up local homes and businesses with cables connected to his power station, the modern electric grid, next to seven thousand three hundred major power plants through nearly one hundred and sixty thousand miles of high voltage transmission lines and millions of miles of low voltage lines to bring power to over one hundred and fifty million customers.  There are only four distinct electrical grids that service essentially all of North America. You have the two big ones, Western and Eastern and the two electrical separatist, Quebec and Texas.  The electrical grid is the most massive machine that humans have ever built in the United States. We use something like five or six times more energy per person than anywhere else in the world.  Of course, Americans consume that much energy. Americans invented a bike that you have to plug in, doesn't even go anywhere and cost more than 10 regular bicycles. But yes, the electrical grid is the most massive machine that man has ever built. And it's amazing how it connects the entire continent. I mean, just think while you're blending a smoothie in your kitchen, Donald Trump is using the same electricity to shred his tax returns.  It's actually beautiful when you think about it.  Wow. So there's no doubt that this is an impressive system, unfortunately, much like a tweet from twenty ten. It hasn't aged well.  The US electric grid loses power almost three times more often than it did in 1980 for much more than any other industrialized nation. Japan loses power an average of four minutes a year. But in the northeast U.S., two hundred fourteen minutes. And it just keeps getting worse.  In 2010 alone, disruptions in our inefficient power grid cost our country in excess of one hundred billion dollars.  We actually lose about 60 percent of the energy that we generate.  Most of the infrastructure that we use today hasn't changed much since 30, 40, 50 years ago.  Some of the country's power systems predate the 20th century. If Thomas Edison walked into a modern substation, he'd feel very much at home.  Yeah, he would feel at home, especially if he saw Joe Biden on TV. A my old pal Joe was president. Joe, why are you so small? Get out of that box, Joe.  But this is pretty worrisome."}]}

As you know, February is Black History Month, and we're celebrating all month long with Roy Wood Junior honoring the unsung heroes of black history with another episode of CP Time.  You get to shoot my stuff because of covid. Let's go. Let's go. Right.  All right.  Let's begin. She forgot to put on pants.  Oh, well, hello there. Welcome to CP Time. The only show that's for the culture. Today, we'll be discussing the history of black spies was I call them Incognegro? Usually I have another camera over there. This is going to take some getting used to. Anyway, I know that usually when you think of spies, you think of white folk like Jason Bourne, James Bond or Jack Bauer despise all white guys with the initial JBI. Oh, my God, Justin Bieber.  But in actuality, black people have a long history of running intelligence operations. For example, you may know Harriet Tubman for her work freeing slaves in the Underground Railroad and for popularizing the vendetta. But what you may not have known was that during the civil war, she worked as a spy for the Union Army. That's right. Harriet Tubman was a spy and she had a great strategy for being ignored by the Confederates. It was called being black. At one point, Harriet Tubman led three black soldiers in a raid on southern plantations.  Can you imagine how terrified slave owners must have been? I was actually when they invented blackface, they put it on and said, yeah, go get those slave owners. Another black spider you may not have known about is James Wormley Jones, who in nineteen nineteen became the FBI's first documented black special agent. In nineteen twenty two, Jones infiltrated a black nationalist organization led by Marcus Garvey and helped get Marcus Garvey convicted of mail fraud. So Jones didn't just break barriers for black people in intelligence.  He also used that intelligence to put black people behind various. He was the original Takashi's six nine. He spied on black people like a pitch black folk didn't just spy for the US government, there were also spies like Josephine Baker, who moved to France in the 1920s when she became a world famous singer. When the Nazis invaded France in World War Two, bakers smuggled secret messages and maps for the French Resistance. When she heard something valuable, she would write it down, pinned a note to her underwear and relayed the information back to Paris.  And that's harder than it sounds. One time in grade school, I tried pinning a secret note to my drawls, ended up pinning my booty cheeks together. Suffice it to say, the school knows was very aware about my secret crush altricial. Well, that's all the time we have for today.  I'm with you. This has been C.P. time from home. And remember, we the culture, we got to tell the facts about Justin Bieber. Somebody need to call you back. Oh, my God. Joe Biden's a JBI to the spaza ever will.  Thank you so much for that, Roy. All right, when we come back right blank, we'll talk about her brand new movie that's getting Oscar buzz.  So stick around.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with writer, director and performer, writer Blank. We talked about her critically acclaimed debut film based on her life and where she goes from here.  Robert Black, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you for having me. I'm such a fan.  Everyone is a fan of yours. I should be the one who's thanking you because I'm going to read a list of just some of your latest achievements and all the accolades that your film is garnering. You have the New York Critics Best First Film Award, the Sundance Directing Award, the L.A. Critics Next Generation Award, the black critics, rising star of what everyone has been showering you and your film with so many awards. I feel bad that I don't have an award.  I just just give you one here. I'm giving you the World Cup. Congratulations. You have won The Daily Show World Cup Award.  It has been quite a ride for you. Are you just surfing on this wave of success?  I'm doing my best travel. I mean, it's weird because it's all happening in a square in a virtual world. And so many times I'm not even present to receive an award. But, you know, I go on Twitter and that makes things all the more real just in terms of people in this celebrations of the project. But it's it's it's been interesting to celebrate anything when so much crazy is going on in the world. Right. I try to find a way.  I try to find a way. Well, for those who don't know your film, the 40 year old version is truly, in my opinion, a cinematic masterpiece. And it's a story loosely based on your life and your journey as a black woman who's a playwright struggling to make her name in an industry that keeps blocking out. And it's heartfelt. It's funny. It's beautifully shot for you. You know, as the person who wrote, directed and starred in this film, I mean, I'm sure a lot of it was personal to you.  Why did you want to, I think, be at the helm of all of those aspects?  Well, it wasn't something I was planning to do. I just felt like in order to tell a story in this way, I had to take control very much like my protagonists. Things weren't going swimmingly well for me in my career. I unlike her, I have not choked a theatre producer, but I have felt the urge to so many of the gatekeepers. And I had gotten fired off of a film job, one of my first screenwriting jobs. And I just I felt like I needed to take my voice back.  And so in order to not get fired, I decided I could play every role so that I couldn't. You know what I mean?  I know exactly what you mean. What's interesting is this is a tale about somebody doing their best to try and achieve their dreams, even beyond their so-called sell sell-by dates.  And then in telling that story, you have achieved that success. Do you do you sometimes think about how surreal it is that the film has ended up in many ways, fulfilling the central narrative of the story?  Yeah, I mean, every single day I there are moments that happen that feel like I'm actually in the film on my character's journey, because very much like my character, I've had a lot of the same obstacles in my way, whether people thought I wasn't CoverGirl or lead material or I didn't have a look or you hit 40, you should be put out to pasture. I really do hope that the messaging of the film, especially for black women, is that you don't age out of your passion.  And if you have the notion to tell a story, do it, take control, follow the lead of many of our DIY filmmakers like Spike Lee, you know, and and find a crew and shoot that shit, shit, shit, shit. I like that. You should put that on a shirt, shoot that shit, shoot that shit. I think that's a fantastic slogan to go with.  I would love to know what it's been like for you as as as a creator. You know, you always wanted to break into Broadway. You always wanted to write. You are a playwright. You want to break into this world. But it has felt like for many, not just yourself, that there are gatekeepers who determine what stories should and shouldn't be told and how they shouldn't shouldn't be told. And you've always bucked that trend almost at your detriment through that in telling that story.  Yeah, well, you know, I feel like while a lot of the people in those positions are well-meaning, they tend to cater to the audience. There's always this kind of dance in terms of what's being programmed. And then when the black plays show up, it seems to be a black story that caters to their their membership's idea of what an authentic black. Where he is, I mean, hence the song Poverty Porn, where, you know, I'm kind of raising a lens on the industry celebration of black pain.  Yes, they're always going to be gatekeepers. And I do think we should call people out when there are racist practices or things that are keeping marginalized people from getting on these stages. But I say don't wait on those people, you know, to affirm you.  You know, a good friend of mine, her name is Danni Guerrera. You may know her as Michel.  She once said to me, yeah, the zombie slaying girl.  She once said to me, after I had been rejected by yet another theater, she said, Stop trying to make these people love you, rather go with alone.  And so I think that the storytellers yes, it's great if we can get Marvel's stories, will get the bigger studios to get behind our storytelling. But what do we do if they don't have to figure out ways to?  And I think that's great because we need independent filmmaking. We need that to be a part of the landscape of storytelling. Everyone can't do a Marvel film.  You know, when you look at your journey, you spent a lot of time knocking on the doors of Broadway. And yet it seems like the film industry has has has welcomed with open arms in celebrating your project. Do you see yourself now going fully into the world of film or do you see yourself coming back to Broadway in some way, shape or form?  You know, some of them theatre producers they call indie. Now, you know what I'm saying is that you would think that was on some Lenfest by and I lost a little weight and Atayal up. It might be, yes.  But, you know, I I hope is an opportunity to tell a story there. I think my voice tends to be lean more towards social justice issues in theatre. And I want to tell those stories. But I did this to break into the filmmaking business. I know people think because I'm in my own film that maybe this was my audition for other roles. Actually, no, this is just me being strategic. I knew I couldn't play thirty nine forever, you know what I mean?  Even I moisturise, but I, I want to make film, I want to make film. I want to compete with major filmmakers of our time.  When when someone is watching this movie they might ask themselves, OK, who is Radha Blank. Is she an actress, is she a filmmaker? I found myself going, is she an undercover M.C.? Because it seems like a joke in the film. But I mean, you know, Reddam is Prima's got some rhymes, Trevor.  I got buzz. I mean, you know, the the forty year old version is an origin tale and I have always been an emcee. And you know, I remember telling somebody I wanted to do a movie about a woman who decided to become an emcee at forty and their first inclination was to laugh. And I kind of got offended by that because it's like, why is this so funny? Saying like, why is that Busta Rhymes, Ghostface and all these other emcees can rhyme in their 40s, 50s and 60s, some of them.  Why couldn't I get some of that? So I am AMC and I will always be one. And I got some stuff coming up. I got some stuff coming up for the naysayers. I think that it is just a joke. But yeah, I feel like the culture I'm the same age is the culture and wacky right now. I still have something to say. I get that at some point it was youth culture. But hip hop has evolved, evolved to include people from different parts of the world, different kinds of lifestyles.  And so, you know, I'm here to rap for the over forty and see because we we do exist.  Yeah. Album title that shit shoot the shit.  That's what I'm saying. And you got a whole Marcheline come in. Drop sixty.  Oh I'm coming through. Are you kidding me. Oh my my my afro man.  The flow from the fro the flow from you don't even understand right now what the flow from the fro woman the to what you you got me.

I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is February 1st, which means it's the start of Black History Month. Yes, my friends, it's that time of the year when white people who are true allies gift their black friends. A five do the right thing, guys. Don't be racist. Anyway, on tonight's show, Reetta Traitor's, a high on Silvo. Anti vaccines are ruining things for everyone.  And we introduce you to an insane Georgia woman who makes laws for the country now.  Plus, Jeremy Harris of Slave Play is joining us on the show. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with terminal use of. All right, let's kick things off with the big snowstorm that slammed into the northeast United States today, where some places will be getting up to twenty four inches of snow. In fact, there was so much snow in New York that we couldn't go anywhere and we had to stay home all day.  It was crazy. But while the sunny West Coast doesn't have to worry about snow, California is having some scary weather related problems of its own.  Amazing new drone video shows where a chunk of California's scenic Highway One collapse after heavy rainstorms last week. Both lanes near Big Sur washed down into the Pacific Ocean. That landslide left a massive gap in the highway and a deep ravine littered with fallen trees. Thankfully, nobody was hurt there. Transportation officials have no estimate of how long it might take to actually fix that. Merchants say that collapsed just another major blow to the area's tourism industry.  Nah, man, if anything, I think a big hole like that is going to help the tourism industry. Let me just look at the Grand Canyon. They want to patch that up years ago, but it's so popular that they've never even bothered. Now, luckily, nobody was on this road when it collapsed, but they do have to fix this road ASAP, because since we all have GPS now, I don't know how obvious that hole is going to be.  People are just going to be like, I mean, yeah, it looks like a hole, but Google says we should just go straight. So, I mean, what's the worst that could happen?  And this does look scary, but you know who did enjoy it, that panda from the National Zoo. Oh, if only we all looked at adorable plunging to our deaths. Let's move on now to the coronavirus pandemic. The only thing with more mutations than Rudy Giuliani. The big issue right now is getting people vaccinated as quickly as possible. And now there's yet another thing making that harder than it should be assholes.  The Los Angeles Times says dozens of anti vaccination protesters disrupted operations at one of the largest vaccine sites in the country. They blocked entrances and forced the inoculation center at Dodger Stadium to close for about an hour Saturday. Hundreds of people waited in their cars to get shots. Some city officials are calling for increased security at testing and vaccination locations.  Whoa. These people in L.A. had to sit in their cars for an hour. How did they notice what all the real the what the fuck t vexes if you don't want the vaccine and don't get one.  I don't agree with you, but don't ruin it for everyone else. Like we don't come interrupt you when you're busy dying of measles, because here's what I don't understand. Why does it always have to be the most ridiculous people who are the most fired up? Like why can't anti vaccines be like those Instagram models were last summer, you know, with just post a black square on Instagram for one day and then never bring up vaccines again. But let's move on now to international news.  Ten years ago, the country of Myanmar emerged from a half century of military rule to transition to civilian governments.  But yesterday, the military apparently decided that they liked it better the old way.  Breaking overnight, developments in Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma. This morning, the military there announced that it took control of the country in a coup against the democratically elected government. It detained several politicians, including the country's civilian leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The raids came hours before a new session of parliament was scheduled to open and members who won the November elections were set to take their seats. The military alleges voter fraud in the November election.  Oh, man. Trump must be kicking himself right now. I don't know why I didn't think about using the military. Can I have a coup over? And here's the thing. I know it's sometimes hard to get Americans to care about another country's politics. So if Myanmar wants to get the US to pay attention, they should change the country's name again, this time to the Capitol building. Yeah, because if Americans heard that there was a coup at the Capitol building, then then at least care about that for like two weeks.  But I am hoping for the best for the people of Myanmar. And what this shows us is that maintaining a civilian led democracy isn't easy and can't be taken for granted. When you think about it, civilians controlling the military is an amazing accomplishment in the first place because the military has way more power. You know, it's like the political equivalent of having a pet tricks. What did I say about jumping on the couch bed?  And finally, let's move on from the coup in Myanmar to the ongoing coup on Wall Street last week. You probably remember day traders won't read it shocked the markets by driving stocks in GameStop, an AMC movie theaters higher than the queen's here in Britain. But now Reddit has its eye on something even more shiny.  The GameStop saga continues to grow. It's not just stocks anymore, though. Reddit users are buying up silver, pushing up the value of the precious metal. Silver has now hit a five month high at nearly thirty bucks an ounce. That Reddit group says that they're doing it because big banks, specifically JP Morgan Chase, have been, quote, suppressing metals for a long time.  Over the weekend, retail sites that sell silver coins and silver bars said that they were getting hit by unprecedented demand and they couldn't meet the demand.  It's been incredible, pretty much physical silver. It's almost all gone in terms of life inventory.  We typically have about a thousand silver products in inventory available for purchase. We're getting so cleaned out right now that we're actually, last I checked, down to about 80 items in stock, which is a number I've never seen before and never thought we would ever see. The entire industry is frankly wiped out in terms of actually finding life silver that you can purchase and receive today. It's becoming impossible.  Oh, hey, I'm rich, I tell ya. Oh, that's right, people.  Now, silver prices are skyrocketing, which is going to cause confusion at the next Olympics. I mean, if silver is more valuable than gold, everyone's going to try and get second place. Sprinters will be at the finish line like after you met FDR.  But after you know, I'm always going first, but I'm always going first. You go ahead of me. Why don't you go ahead of me this time? You can go first right now.  While some Reddit users say that driving silver prices higher will cripple banks like JP Morgan, others claim that this movement is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms because it would help the banks. And I believe this because, of course, Wall Street will do that when Wall Street sees a scam going, it doesn't try to stop it, it tries to join in. If Wall Street caught you, robbing its mom would be like, hey, hey, look, I don't want to take off our shoes.  Sometimes she hides cash in there. Get in there. Let me get in there with.  It's coordinated by the banks themselves a lot. The fact is the credit surge is now spreading from game stock to silver to all sorts of stocks. And one of our correspondents has a pitch for where it should go next.  Are you a creditor looking to stick it to the hedge funds? Well, forget about GameStop and Silver.  You got to invest in Kiwi's. I'm lighting. And Kiwi's are the investment opportunity that Wall Street doesn't want you to know about. They're portable. They hold their intrinsic value. And it's easy to think you're ordering 10 from Amazon and miraculously wind up with ten crates.  Here's a fact.  As far as we know, every single hedge fund is shorting Kiwi's. And are we going to let them do that to America's national fruit? I don't think so. But if we all buy Kiwi's, then rocket ship and Kiwis are more than an investment.  They go great in fruit salads. They can be organic Trepp nuts, and they're the only fruit covered in fur. So if you ever wonder what it's like to take a bite out of a hamster, now you can with Kiwi's.  And the best part is you don't even have to go through those Wall Street fat cats to get your Kiwi's, just call me and let me know how many you want, whether five or five thousand.  But this opportunity will not last forever.  Got maybe two days tops before it smells so bad in here that my landlord kicks me out. So order now. And remember, the more Kiwis we all buy, the more the hedge funds suffer.  It's just economics. So called today. Please, honey, what did you do? I'm handling it.  All right. When we come back, we'll look at one of the newest and most terrifying stars of the Republican Party. You don't want to miss it.

Hey, hey, we're giving a whole bunch of good, bad advice and a lot of bad redivide, trying to teach you how to say when, how and how much. Yes. Now, that doesn't always have to apply to your sex life, lady.  It can absolutely apply to your career unless your sex life is your career. And in this age, we'll be talking about a whole lot of sex. I love the sex in a place and the love of money and relationship, and we're going to work on it.  So listen to our new show. We Talk Back every Thursday on the radio app, Apple podcast, or wherever you get your podcast. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Last year's election brought a lot of new faces to Washington, D.C., but just like that kid at Sleep Away camp who keeps wetting the bed, one of them may be going home.  Early tonight, growing outrage at newly elected Representative Marjorie Taylor Green. The noted conspiracy theorist and ardent Trump supporter from Georgia, is facing calls to resign and a long shot bid to expel her from Congress after a review of her social media found in twenty, eighteen and 19, she repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a widely shared video from twenty nineteen Al Green declaring Pelosi a traitor, implying she should be executed.  It's a crime punishable by death is not treason. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.  She's called for the hanging of Barack Obama. She's called for the hanging of Hillary Clinton.  Right now they're trying to expel me from Congress, yet they don't like I don't like a lot of the things I say and do. They're they're you know, it's a witch hunt.  Yeah. They don't like the things you said because you called for the execution. They're not looking for a witch hunt. They're looking to stay alive. I mean, people. What kind of psychopath calls for the execution of America's leaders on Facebook? I mean, at least if he did it on Snapchat, it would be harder to find. Also, the puppy knows makes you seem less crazy. And here's why I take this assassination. Talk seriously from Marjorie Taylor Green.  She's got three names. Assassins always have three names. Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth, Neil Patrick Harris. That guy kills every award show. So who is this person that might get expelled from Congress after less than a month? Well, let's get to know her and our brand new segment, Fringe Watching.  Meet Marjorie Taylor Green in Congress, she represents Georgia's 14th District right outside Atlanta. And in life, she represents some views right outside of reality.  Marjorie Taylor Green, she won her house race for a district in northwest Georgia. She has in the past promoted the Kuhnen conspiracy theories.  Q is a patriot. We know that for sure, but we do not know who Q is. People believe that. Q Is someone very close to President Trump? According to him, many in our government are actively worshipping Satan or they call Moloch. I mean, is it going to be true that the child pedophilia and the elites in the Washington DC, is that what we're really going to see come out? Is it going to be satanic worship?  Who was in the House of Representatives? Now, Marjorie Taylor Green is hardly the first member of Congress to hold some out of their beliefs. I mean, Ted Cruz believes that beard is working for him. But Kuhnen is not just extreme. It's delusional people. How are you going to be in the government and believe that the government is full of Satan worshipping sex predators? I mean, it must be exhausting to be walking around the halls of Congress just constantly opening doors like, ha, no, just a supply closet that, you know, just a copy room.  But, you know, that's my office, man. I'm so lost. And it's not just Kuhnen. In fact, it seems like Green has a conspiracy theory for every letter of the alphabet.  The Trump backing Republican embraces completely false Kuhnen conspiracy theories. And in a newly uncovered video from twenty eighteen claimed former President Obama is Muslim.  The Clintons had JFK Jr. killed and even questioned whether a plane crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11.  It's odd there's never any evidence shown for a plane and the Pentagon. Facebook posts have surfaced in which Green called the deadly Parkland High School shooting fake, along with video showing her harassing Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg's. Why are you supporting red flag gun laws that attack our Second Amendment right? How do you get avid gun owners and people that support the Second Amendment to give up their guns and go along with anti-gun legislation? How do you do that? Maybe you accomplished that by performing a mass shooting into a crowd that is very likely to be conservative.  Is that what happened in Las Vegas?  Have you seen the picture of Ruth Bader Gingrich walking to the airport?  Yeah, like a body double for Hillary Clinton. So it's interesting."}]}

President Joseph pours a Biden over the weekend, Biden took a short break from his day to day president to catch the Super Bowl from his home in Delaware. And if you aren't immediately outraged about that, well, you obviously haven't been watching the last forty eight hours of conservative news media.  Joe Biden is planning to travel across state lines to watch the Super Bowl, despite calls from the CDC not to travel. Biden and his wife, Jill, are going to spend the weekend at their Delaware home. Now, this just a few days after the CDC warned Americans against traveling this weekend, stressing it could increase their chances of spreading the coronavirus.  What happened to the suggestion that you shouldn't travel during this covid epidemic?  He's setting a horrible example and he's not practicing what he preaches in any shape, form or fashion. And if he really thinks that going out and traveling at this particular point in time is putting people at risk, then he's doing exactly that. He's putting thousands and thousands of people at risk by doing this. It's very hypocritical.  Why does he need to go? What's wrong with the White House? What's wrong with spending the weekend in the white?  I guess on believable? You are setting a horrible example, Joe. If you go to your home in Delaware soon, everyone will go to your home in Delaware and then they'll expect snacks. Joe, and what are you going to do, buy tortilla chips for three hundred million people? There's no way the store has that many. So you're going to have to get those quinoa chips. And I know they're better for you, but they taste like cardboard, Joe.  And don't tell me all but Trevor isn't that different because he's the president and he's flying on Air Force One. No. What if I fly on Air Force One right off to Joe Biden, huh? Coronavirus can linger for hours, people. And I also know that people are saying, oh, come on, why are you criticizing Biden for traveling during the pandemic when Donald Trump spent every weekend golfing and coughing on the buffet table and hosting rallies at the same time?  But that's not the same. Donald Trump wasn't being a hypocrite because he wanted people to dive covid. But it's not surprising that Biden bent the travel rules for himself because he's been president for less than three weeks. And already he's had more scandals than we can keep track of. Although, my friends, we are going to try and our brand new segment, Joe Biden, the worst president in history that we can remember.  There are two things that are unforgivable for any American politicians releasing the aliens from area fifty one and insulting the troops.  And last week, Biden's press secretary launched a gratuitous attack on the newest and bravest troops of all.  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki facing criticism for mocking the space force, whether the president has made a decision on keeping or keeping the scope of space force.  Wow, Space Force. It is an interesting question. I am happy to check with our space for a point of contact. And I assure you that is I will find out and see if we have any update on that. Well, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee is now calling that comment disgraceful. And he's asking the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, to apologize. She's literally, openly mocking the branch of military that was actually enacted by Congress with Democratic support.  There's some arrogance there. There's a little condescension as well. One hundred years from now, the Space Force will be one of the important parts of our military.  This is no joke. How dare you? Jen Psaki, Space Force is an illustrious branch of the military that was formed an entire year ago because Donald Trump had a weird sex dream about herself.  If you're going to mock Spaceballs, maybe, maybe you should mock all the people who were cut in half when Neptun stole Saturn's rings and threw them at Earth.  A weight that never happened because space for saved us space is no joke, OK, this isn't funny. America is sending troops to space where they have to poop in a little bag. You think that's funny? And if the bag is to fool the poop escapes and have to chase the floating poop around the spaceship, does that sound funny to you guys? A bunch of guys in fancy uniforms floating around the room trying to grab a poop, and then the boss opens the door and he says, what's going on?  Then the poop goes in his mouth. Is that a joke to you? You think any of this shit is funny, huh? Now, insulting the military is bad enough. But before the space for scandal had even died down, Joe Biden took things a step further, this time attacking the honor and decency of our heroes in law enforcement.  There is some controversy over comments that the new president made about these about FBI agents as a generality. He made these comments and it's getting a lot of reaction.  Listen, by and large, the vast, vast majority of these men and women are decent, honorable people.  What should be taken away from that for him to, say the vast majority of men and women are decent, honorable people.  Why suddenly the qualifiers on the arbitration of who's a good guy and who's a bad guy?  What percentage of people are we talking? Or 80 percent good and decent people at the FBI? 90. Can you be more specific?  Yeah. Joe Biden, be more specific. Is it ninety nine percent or is it just one bad guy, huh? Is it Doug? It's totally Doug, isn't it. I knew it. You know, he cheats on Margaret, right?  Like what have you heard? But this is just reprehensible. How dare you say that the vast, vast majority of FBI agents are honorable when clearly it is the vast, vast, vast majority. I mean, if you care about those agents at all, you would have thrown in a third bust. And I especially understand why this must have been a shock for the folks over at Fox News to hear a president slander the brave members of the corrupt deep state like that.  I just hope the decent, honorable scumbags like James Comey don't hear about this. Now, look, it's not surprising that Joe Biden is bringing scandal to the White House.  I mean, after all, his entire campaign was little more than just a front to launder money for his son, Hunter Biden. And just as everyone predicted, Hunter is already turning daddy's presidency into his own personal piggy bank.  So Hunter Biden has a new book that is set to come out within his father's first hundred days. But critics are pointing out President Biden said his family wasn't going to do this. They weren't going to cash in on his presidency. Do you write a book for free?  The real concern here, though, is Simon and Schuster is is is the is the company that canceled Josh Holly in his book, but they're doing the book for Hunter Biden.  How will this book be used? Will will it be a kind of test of loyalty to Joe Biden to buy the book? Will it be Marseille's?  Yes, my friends, welcome to Joe Biden's America, where if you want to covid vaccine, you'll have to pass a pop quiz on Hunta Biden's book. What important lesson can Hunter Biden learn in Chapter nine to believe in himself? Wrong. Give him covid. And what if you're not getting the vaccine? Biden will still know if you bought the book. You know why? Because our bookshelves in the background of all our zoo meetings, did Joe Biden engineer the coronavirus just to make sure we all bought his son's book?  I'm just asking questions. But yes, that's what happened. This is what we're facing people scandal after scandal after scandal. The unfortunate truth is that Joe Biden is incapable of doing literally anything right as president. In fact, even before his first day in office was finished, Biden had racked up three major scandals.  Joe Biden made fighting the coronavirus pandemic the main staple of his campaign. However, many have noticed that Biden and other high level officials at his own inauguration were failing to socially distance. Even wearing their masks was at times optional or not correct the way they were doing it when they were within six feet of others. Look, there was a lot of hugging going on, and these are not necessarily people who shared bubbles. Joe Biden hired private security as if he were not satisfied with the National Guard and the military.  He wanted even more guns at his behest.  Joe Biden jumped the gun a little bit today. He got sworn in at ten minutes to noon. I don't mean to nit pick, but he does say noon, according to the law.  That's right. Joe Biden stole ten minutes of Donald Trump's presidency. Watch. Fox News calls it 10 Ghazi. Who knows what Trump could have accomplished in those ten minutes? I mean, maybe that's when he was finally going to release his health care plan. He could have used that time to walk down half a ramp. And do you have any idea how much Fox News Trump could have watched in that ten minutes?  Like ten minutes. So those are the many Joe Biden scandals exposed by the muckraking journalists of conservative media in just his first three weeks in office. And who knows, by this time tomorrow, we could find out that Biden left the toilet seat up or even worse, spoiled the end of joy division.  The Super Bowl, it's the world championship of a sport only played in America, and yesterday's game was one for the record books this morning, Tom Brady is running out of fingers for his rings, capturing his record seventh Super Bowl at age 43.  I think we knew this was going to happen. I didn't win. The Bucks didn't just win. They tripled last year's champs, the Kansas City Chiefs. Thirty one to nine the weekend also electrifying on stage, singing some of his biggest hits in a slickly produced halftime show. Using mass dancers to keep things covid friendly, how, yeah, what a great halftime show and it looks like the weekend finally found a use for that toilet paper has been haunting.  And how about Tom Brady winning his seventh Super Bowl ring? At this rate, he's going to be the first player with a Super Bowl to ring people. I mean, at this point, Tom Brady has led the kind of life that eight year olds narrates to themselves in the backyard.  The crowd goes when Tommy wins in seven Super Bowl. And now he's rich and he's married to a supermodel and now he's riding a dinosaur. Rah rah.  And look, I know a lot of people don't like Tom Brady. Anyway, let's move on now from the Super Bowl to the big game in Washington. Tomorrow, the US Senate will begin its annual impeachment trial of Donald Trump, and there's three possible outcomes. He could be convicted, he could be exonerated or the most likely one. He could commit new crimes during the trial that he'll get impeached for next year. But whatever happens to Trump, hundreds of his followers already facing consequences for rioting at the capital, although at least one of them is getting a chance to cut loose before she might get locked up.  A woman accused of participating in the deadly capital riot will get to go on vacation later this month.  A judge in Washington, D.C., granted Jenny Cuds request to travel to Mexico. The motion was granted and filed yesterday. Cuds lawyers say she had a prepaid weekend retreat for herself and her employees at Becky's Flowers to go to Riviera Maya, Mexico. The retreat would reportedly serve as a work related bonding time for employees and their spouses all year insurrectionary Club Med Kozmo.  Honestly, if I were this woman's employee, I'd be a little nervous to go on a bonding retreat. I mean, these aren't the kind of people I'm putting on a blindfold and going on a trust hike with. OK, I'm sticking my hands out. All right. Closing them, like you said. Wait, how long am and what am I do? Am I strangling Nancy Pelosi? I'm not cool. Jenny, what I love about this is that this woman planned the vacation before she participated in the riots.  So in her head, she was going to go to Washington, overthrow the government, and then what, hit the beach for two weeks? I'm like, how serious of a revolution were you planning, lady? These riots were all shouting that it's seventeen seventy six again. But none of the founding fathers were like on July 4th, we declare our independence. Then on July 5th we got that beach house in Cabo, Thomas Furin. It's going to be liberal.  And look, obviously, I want this woman to be held accountable for her actions, but I also kind of want to party with her in Mexico.  I mean, think about it. If she and her friends can turn a boring election certification vote into this, you best believe this spring breaks are going to be wild.  And look, I know a lot of people are angry about the story, but the law says that if you can post bail and you aren't a flight risk, you can go back to your life until they actually convict. You have a crime. And I'll be honest, I agree with that concept. No one should sit in a jail cell because they might be a criminal if anything. The problem I have is that people who can't afford bail have to stay in jail.  I mean, one of the courts scared of no one is easier to keep tabs on than a broke person, you know, where a broke person isn't going to Mexico or the movies or out to dinner. You want to check a broke person? They're at home. And finally, some education news.  February is Black History Month, a beautiful time in America when Americans celebrate all the black people who died rather than help the black people who are still alive. But now a debate about how to teach black history is causing a bit of a stir in one of America's least black states.  In Utah, a school reverses a decision which would have allowed parents to opt out of lessons on Black History Month. This is happening at a charter school in Ogden, Utah. Initially, the school's director said he was asked by several families to opt out and he obliged and sent out a document asking if other parents wanted to do the same thing. But now the school is backtracking after pushback from parents and black history supporters.  Wow. First of all, what an embarrassment for the school. If I were them, I'd try to play the whole thing off as an intentional history lesson.  You see parents, you wanted to opt out, but you're not allowed to just like the slaves couldn't. Black history accomplished. Now people are saying that trying to opt out of black history is racist. But even more than that, it's stupid because black history is exciting. It's got racism, war, oppression, dudes with afros and leather jackets. If you have to opt out of something, you should opt out of boring shit like trigonometry. You don't need to know that an isosceles triangle has four sides, trust me.  Regardless, though, it's a good thing the school backtracked because this is a slippery slope. If you let kids opt out of black history, then you'll have to let them opt out of white history. And then what? Asian history. And before you know what kids will be showing up to school, like back off teach. I'm just here for lunch. It's hard to give your body the nourishment it needs every day.

I love the sex and a bunch of money. We love the money and relationships. We're don't work on it. And it feels like Josh and listen to we talk back every Thursday on the radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your is.  Amanda Goldman, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show. Thank you so much for having me. I'm super excited. I'm the one who should be excited because, I mean, twenty twenty one kicked off with a bang. It's been a whirlwind for everybody. But I think for you, more than most people, it has been extra whirlwind, which is a word I trademarked.  You can use one day if you'd like to add one of your poems, you you went from not just being notable because you read a poem, the youngest ever inaugural poet, but also because of what the poem meant to people, because of the inspiration behind it, because of how people felt after they heard what you did. What has it been like for you just just in this little period since the inauguration? What has your world been like?  My world has been crazy. I mean, it's been turned upside down. I mean, when I was writing the poem, I knew it was a historic moment. I knew was an important moment, which is why I wanted to do just service. But I wasn't really paying attention to the ways in which my own personal life might change. So I went I did my job a poem. I walked off and just kind of expected everything to be the same.  And then I remember trying to open my Instagram just to look at other people's posts in all of my apps and just crashed because of all the followers that were just flocking to my channel. So it's been amazing and I'm still kind of absorbing it all like a sponge.  The poem The Hill We Climb wasn't just momentous because of the day it was performed on. I think what made it so special was that you incorporated up until that day the things that so many people were feeling about America. If you don't mind, walk me through why you felt it was important to write a poem for that moment and then even still be writing the poem on the actual day that you were delivering it.  Right, exactly. Well, for me, I mean, I was writing it and trying to find a way to encapsulate what had gone on over the past four years and even looking more expansively than that. And then, you know, we had the interaction at the capital. So for me, it was trying to say we've had this reminder of the ways in which democracy is both fragile and also enduring and how it is to defend it. And I think a lot of times in cultures, we think of the ways in which we can cleanse ourselves with water.  I think of the ways that we can cleanse herself with words, meaning that was an opportunity to kind of re sanctify. We purify and reclaim not just the capital building, but American democracy and what it stands for, a pretty high ask of myself. But that's what I did when I showed up and I rolled up my sleeves. And that was the aim of the poem, to use words to try to go back to the quintessence of what America can be.  I think you achieve that. I think you achieve that a thousand times over. And it showed in how people responded. I mean, consider it from this perspective and you may not, but this is how I saw it. I went on a day when Joe Biden's inaugurated. Kamala Harris is stepping into the role as VP. Lady Gaga is performing. Jennifer Lopez is performing you with a thing that people would look at. You would you were the trending thing.  I mean, it was like you competing with like Bernie Sanders is was basically it. That must be. Do you take a moment to go like, man, this is surreal.  That is so surreal, especially because my friends there are so funny and they come for blood. So they were texting me like, well, Joe Biden did a good job opening up for Amanda Gorman. You know who won that? I'm not you know, it's not a competition. It's not a fight over who wins the inauguration. They're like, but you did. And so I think for me, it was so daunting to be on a stage. You know, there's Michelle Obama to my right and Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and what have been so the figures that have been mythologized for me and to find myself not only being in that space, but owning it and claiming it was, I think, the highlight of my career.  I believe that you are slated to perform at the Super Bowl. That is correct, yes. I didn't understand. You understand the juxtaposition of this right now.  Write poetry at the Super Bowl. You understand the levels you've made it to where they would like this person is so good that we have to bring her to do poetry at the Super Bowl.  Right. Believe that went over my head because I knew about the Super Bowl and the inauguration around the same time. And it was like there was not space in my head for like I kept being like I got to right that inauguration poem. And my team was like, there's this little thing called the Super Bowl, which you should also keep in mind. And so, you know, it's very rare. And I want to say, you know, it's not an exciting possibility that a poet will be at something like the Super Bowl.  It's just nothing I have heard about before. And so the moments I strive for in my lifetime, which is to bring poetry into the spaces that we least expect it so that we can fully kind of grapple with the ways in which it can heal and kind of resurrect us.  Mr.. A little bit about poetry. I mean, it feels like poetry, like some art forms has it has its highs and then it has moments where it disappears. Why do you think we should never forget poetry? What is it about poetry that you feel society needs to hold on to?  Well, what I always say is poetry stands as a great reminder of the past that we stand on in the future that we stand for. I do not think it is any coincidence that when America seeks to kind of consecrate its ideals, it does so through poetry. I don't think it's sadness that we see a poem at the base of the Statue of Liberty as opposed to like a scientific formula or even a prosaic paragraph. Why is it that we call forth poetry in those moments or even point out to students, when you're at a Black Lives Matter march and you see banners that say they buried us but they didn't know we?  That's poetry at the racial justice movement. And so poetry, because it's inherently rebellious in its nature, I think it really becomes the language and the rhetoric of the people we get to kind of co-opt it and play on it. And what's more, we get to use those words to realize our thoughts and transform those thoughts and actions.  You have a journey ahead of you that I think nobody can predict, which is exciting. And you've had a journey that has been unpredictable. You you've you've talked about it growing up in a family with a single mom who was raising yourself and your twin sister and your brother as well, and and how you just fought to achieve. My question to you then is what are you aspiring to seeing that you've basically done it all? I mean, in the past few weeks?  That's a great question. I mean, I'm really taking that time to kind of sit back and think and be like, well, wow, that was it. Kind of what's next? And for me, I don't think it's about kind of beating my last thing or even competing against myself. I hear that a lot. And that's fine for other people. I'm not necessarily fighting against myself or competing or contesting against anything I've done, but I want to keep on the trajectory that I've started for myself.  I never want to kind of dally or diverge from that. And for me, that just means using my poetry to touch and heal and impact as many people as possible. And that can be at the inauguration and the Super Bowl. It can be in a living room. It's often in classrooms and other students. And so that's what's next for me on the more like resum\u00e9 tick thing that I always have to mention when I'm on talk shows and like, I have three books coming out.  So there's also what I need to write. But, you know, I'm just chugging forward.  Well, I know everyone's going to be reading the books. Thank you so much, Amanda Goldman, and congratulations on all your success.  Thank you so much.

Are you doing the spinning bad boy shot that we always do? The bad boy shot. Stop it.  I understand the Democrats movie making angle, but how is this blockbuster approach playing with the few locals we could actually find?  The first impeachment gets in the weeds feels a little bit more like a complicated spy drama made by a foreign director. This new one, this new one, I think is just so obvious, you know? Well, a drama and chaos, unfortunately, murder and sedition, you know, it has all of a good plot, twists of a crime. I'm not excited about it because the fact that it had to happen is because something horrible happened in the first place.  You're not excited for the new impeachment. Would you say you're getting too old for this shit? I am Bruce Willis. Too old for this shit anyway. Danny Glover, you know, Lethal Weapon. Danny Glover. I guess Bruce Willis was getting too old for the Die Hard series in and of itself. All I'm saying is somebody needs to say, hasta la vista, baby. Am I right? As long as there's not a third movie, I'll be great.  I hope you're right.  Although we do have a villain who's never been held accountable in his life, it kind of keeps the franchise open. I think they had a good opening day with the video. And I think Jamie Raskin did a really good job of explaining that some people were either getting ready to just hide behind their desk or like grab a pair of scissors and go out and scream, really want to run, make it personal. Give us people to care about exactly which.  Jordan why Jordan Peele, you should be able to get up and impeach him. Manager He's too busy making scary stuff that I only stay through half of it because it's both scary. And I have certain race guilt issues because of my privilege.  Showing hours and hours of footage of blatant criminality seems like a sound legal tactic. So how does the twenty twenty lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff feel? The sequel stacks up to the original hours.  Might have been more the Ken Burns documentary. This might be more of the HBO miniseries, but, you know, we had to try to bring to life events that were happening half a world away in Ukraine. Here, you don't have to imagine anything because the senators were there, the House members were there. We watched it on our television screens. Why do you think the impeachment is necessary? It's absolutely necessary. If he's not disqualified now, if the senators don't follow their oath and don't follow the evidence and he's acquitted again and he decides to run again, he will put the country through hell again.  There's accountability, really. America's thing. I mean, that's we're better at, like barbecue and wrap around sunglasses. I think that the lack of priority on accountability over the last several years has been why we're in this predicament. There are critics who say Congress should go back to doing more important things like stopping the space lasers that are causing all the wildfires. Should we be focusing on those big, important issues? This points to another huge problem, not the lasers, the wildfires, but the people who believe the people who believe in that kooky, crazy batshit conspiracy theory stuff.  They're members of Congress. Now, how do you convince people who are both witnesses and jurors to a crime that a crime actually occurred?  The Republican Party needs to be a party of ideas and ideology. Again, at the end of the day, what this is really about is can they find the courage to tell their constituents back home that what? They were fed by Donald Trump was a bunch of lies. So you're banking on the courage of someone like Ted Cruz. Good luck with that. He's going to pick on that. I would be bankrupt a long time ago. I was going to say he won't even stand up for his wife, let alone the country.  So so the final jury is the American people, which didn't like rotten tomatoes. It's like the critics score versus the audience score. Now, the first debate. It was great. Critics loved it. Audience was so so on it. But maybe for this new one, the audience score pops right up and there's a conviction. Well, I'm hoping that the the audience score on the senator score are in alignment. And they both say we never want to see the likes of Donald Trump in office again.  So will impeachment, too. Don't rush to Judgment Day move any Senate Republicans to convict Trump as I look around or transform capital for signs of hope. I know no more bad boy shots.  OK, I'm. No, no.  Thank you so much for that, John. All right. When we come back, Daniel Kaluuya joins me on the show to talk about his brand new movie, Judas and the Black Messiah. You don't miss it.  Does anybody want breakfast? Guys, let's go. I'm leaving for McDonald's in five seconds.  Why aren't they the breakfast stampede meal? It's only at McDonald's where there's a meal for every morning and nothing says morning like a classic Sausage McMuffin with egg right.  Now, get this all time favorite for just two bucks on the one, two, three dollar menu. Price and participation may vary. Cannot be combined with any other offer. A combo meal. Ba ba ba ba.  Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today I spoke with award winning actor Daniel Kaluuya. We talked about his brand new film where he portrays Black Panther Chairman Fred Hampton. I am a revolutionary in several moscona.  You can kill a revolutionary, but you can't kill a revolution. I tell you something, then you can do it. That is my favorite. Let me tell you something, man. It's been a while since I watched a movie, man. Kudos to everyone. Kudos to yourself. Kudos to Keith. Kudos to Shuker King. This this is Yemen. I if I had the Oscars at my house, I would just give them to you. Now to go to the awards.  We just take the Oscars. We give them to you now and you go home and you do whatever you want with them. How are you doing?  Go for it, bro. This this Chris Graham speak about this. No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. You know, when you did something that you're proud of. Yeah. Everyone put everything into that and we put everything into that. So I'm feeling good. Man, how you like your humor.  Thank you very much, man. I'm ready to join the Black Panther Party. That's what I'm ready to do.  I can see on the front line with that to feed some kids with the breakfast program right now.  Oh, man, this movie. And you you must be tired, man. You must be running around doing press because everybody should want to speak to you about this film, Judas and the Black Messiah. Like, look, Daniel, you've known for a long time. I'm one of your biggest fans. But, you know, there are things that, you know, even if you love Lionel Messi, that's still a goal that he'll score where you're like, how did he do that?  Even if you love Ronaldo, he'll do like a kick you like. How did he do that? That's what I feel like you do with your acting, is I know how you act. I love how you act, whether it's queen and slim, you know, whether it's get out. It doesn't matter what it is. But in this film and Judas in the Black Messiah, we see a side of not just the Black Panther Party, but Fred Hampton that I think many people wouldn't know about in American history.  Tell me a little bit about the story and why Daniel Collier decided not. I think I can bring this person to life in a way that a lot of people haven't seen before.  Yes. Yes. You know, Chairman Fred, he is a man of the people. You know, he was in Chicago and he became chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party.  And Ryan and Coogler actually pulled me to the side of the Black Panther reshoots and asked me to be a part of it. And when I just go on it, I just feel honored that they even saw me in that way. You know, it kind of exciting that came to me. They saw it before I saw it.  And and and then, yeah, I just read the script and I was just like, you know, there's a lot of information about how he died, but it's not a lot of information about how remarkably he lived. Right. That's what it is. It's just like, wow, this this guy lived incredibly doesn't like he knew things on a deep, deep, deep level.  And not only knew them execute them, though, the knowledge. And he had original thoughts. And then he he did something about it in a way that was digestible to people that were like him. You know, it's like there's so much that has to happen.  Then he was twenty twenty one. But it's you know, it's like he was just I say he's like is a brilliant mind and a brilliant heart. So for that it was kind of like, you know, it's kind of like a way to serve something that that was that was articulated, the stuff that you believed.  But also it's that kind of like it was learning about Chairman Fred allowed me to grow as a man. I can only imagine. So I look at my preconceptions, look at my fears and hang ups that I had and kind of grow in order to kind of occupy his words.  You know, I think preconceptions is the perfect word because the stories that we've been told about so many historical figures are told by the people who oftentimes either end of their lives prematurely or didn't want them to free the people they were trying to free. I mean, Nelson Mandela was labeled as a terrorist. You know, Mahatma Gandhi was persona non grata with the British. Fred Hampton was no different. And what I love about the story is it doesn't show us a simplistic view of the Black Panther Party or Fred Hampton.  It shows us a holistic view in this film that we all these are human beings fighting for their rights. And what I loved was how the story talks about how the Black Panther Party built a coalition of black, white and Hispanic to fight against oppression.  Yeah, that was that was the scariest thing to the powers that be know is that that Chairman Fred had the the knowledge, the clarity and the ability to kind of see people from different communities and understand that they were they were more aligned than people would think, especially people that they had conflicts with, like the young patriots. You know, there's a scene in the film where we go and then we're greeted with the Confederate flag, you know, and even in conflict, Chairman Fred in the Black Panther Party found points of interest, you know, and but not in sacrifice of their love, of blackness and love of the black community, because we live in a day and age.  If you join with someone that isn't aligned, if you feel like you're selling out, you're compromising yourself. Is that that thought was even in that mind. It was all to bolster the love for the community. But they saw that they were in solidarity then fragmentation.  You know, I would love to know from your side as Daniel, how did you begin to embody Fred the way that you did? Like what? What did you look for in him that helped you bring him to life in this movie, you know, is trouble kind of. I was in a space where I would watch his speeches and be aware of how I was feeling as a result of it and going how I was feeling moved and and not so then I was like, oh, my goal is to occupy his spiritual space, that position.  And co I want to move the audience in the way that he is moving me at this moment. You know, I don't really know the words, but that feeling that I felt.  But I knew I felt it and I said I knew I was able to occupy it and I was like, cool, let me just go there. Let me have that as my aspiration in terms of this. And that's kind of it's kind of like you're a vessel in those situations. And certain scenes were saying things at your words. You can't help but let the words tell you how to play the will tell you how to be the voice, me through the voice and how important that was, because I feel like Get-Out was all about the eyes.  You know, you you made those eyes come alive. It felt like that was the whole story. And it felt like in this a lot of Fred is that voice.  Yeah, it was the voice was everything in in approaching it. So then I was when I started dial it. What would you like. An amazing dialect coach. It was a real kind of real challenge. And also another thing was what I had to really watch my voice because I'm not classically trained well.  How I arrived to acting was a very raw improv way. Yeah. And that's when I did plays to kind of just go and just lead with emotion but damage my voice. And I knew on this one I couldn't afford to because you're doing twelve hour days with just doing speeches. So Audrey said, you know, you should look into a singing coach. So I found an opera singing coach. Wow. I'm with an opera singing coach.  And then and then because I just I love the way opera singers commanded the space or sonically Chairman Fred felt like that, you know, how he occupied a room, you know, he just occupied it. And and because of the amount I was doing, I needed to engage my diaphragm and condition my vocal cords for those kind of days.  And so I would do gospel songs and I would do songs that felt like Chairman Fred speeches that I would do the speeches and then I would study in Cadence because he had a different cadence to when he spoke to different cadence when he did speech.  Right. Right.  I identify him defining those differences, but also feeling like the same person is kind of like it was it was there was a kind of but also it was for me it was what was the speech patterns was like a clue into his book.  And having spent all this time embodying the man, researching him, living in him, you know, recreating that history, what do you think some of the misconceptions are that people have about Fred Hampton that you've learned about him and and maybe has changed in your mind as well since taking on this role?  I was blessed enough that I didn't have any preconceptions about him, you know, and I didn't have any preconceptions about the Black Panther Party.  I just understood the other people in order for, you know, the white fair dressed as. Right. Right. Right.  Manifested as like these people are like killing us. They're terrorists.  They like the Ku Klux Klan, you know, and it's that kind of thing.  Well, I actually I thought, like, these people were like incredible, uncompromising love for themselves. And they would they would God themselves with guns and a God, the community with guns, because because you're trying to kill us, you know, it's like if you don't protect your family, I say someone better comes into your house and you don't protect your family. What are you saying about yourself and what you're saying about how you feel about your family?  You know, everyone understands that scenario, but I think the black community within America, there's a lot happening as these people are occupying that space, is oppressing these people and black people around the world. Right. If you don't stand up for yourself, that doesn't make sense. It makes sense to protect yourself. But he's not only did they protect themselves, they loved themselves themselves, you know, and the protection was just a manifestation of a form of love.  You know, one one thing that really stood out to me in this film was realizing how people are connected around the globe without even realizing it. When you watch the story of the Black Panthers, they were an international organization. They were here, you know, when they were trying to expand in the US."}]}

We have a 100 percent proof. And then I when they took it down my recycle, I put it back up my personal.  I put it it was my thank you very much, my friend. Mike, you're talking about machines that Newsmax have not been able to verify any of those kinds of allegations. We just want to let people know that there's nothing substantive that we've seen. And let me read you something there. While there were some clear evidence of some cases of voter fraud and election irregularities, the election result in every state were certified. And Newsmax accepts the results as legal and final.  The courts have also supported that view.  So we wanted to talk to you about canceling this culture, if you will. We don't want to relitigate the allegations that you're making, Mike, because we understand where you are. So let me ask you this. Do you think that this should be temporary because it appears to be permanent? Could you make an argument that it is temporary?  What could you make an argument that this could be a temporary banning rather than permanent? No, I wanted to be a permanent because you know what the agenda is, because I'm revealing all the evidence on Friday of all the election that these machines. So I'm sorry. OK, now, Mike, can I ask our producers, can we get out of here, please? I don't want to have to keep going over this. We have not been able to verify any of those allegations.  Major, you're my. Hold on a second. Everybody hold on a second. Mike, Mike, hold on one second. Let's talk a little bit about just what is happening.  Damn, that defamation lawsuit has Newsmax shook. See that dude? He pissed out of there like the Chipotle he just hit. But you see, that's the power of the courts right there because Mike Lyndell tried to stage a coup and Newsmax was fine with inviting him on. But the second he started saying shit that was going to get them sued, all of a sudden they're like, no, no, no, no, no.  My man, overthrowing the government is one thing, but a lawsuit that's not serious.  And keep in mind, this is Newsmax we're talking about. Remember, Newsmax is like Fox News after it stopped taking its meds. But at least for a minute, Dominion managed to sue them into behaving like actual journalists, according to this statement from my lawyer. Your facts are correct.  It's safe to say that any NBA game where LeBron plays is going to be exciting, but the real action at Monday's Lakers Hawks game was happening courtside.  She's being called courtside. Karen, after getting into a heated courtside exchange with LeBron James, just got kicked out of the game.  But during the verbal altercation with LeBron, her mask came down. You can hear a security guard talk to her. Once she got kicked out, she was still livid. Listen, let me tell you, LeBron James looked at my husband during the game and took him out. And I stood up and I go, don't talk to my husband, talk to my husband one more time that you.  LeBron added the following quote, I thought I was talking to a father and daughter until she started calling him husband. I was stunned by the shade.  LeBron finished that game with twenty one points, nine assists and one murder. But come on, guys, we know that that guy wasn't her dad because a daughter would have just been like, oh, my God, Dad, you're embarrassing me. Drag him, LeBron, by the way. It is really good to see fans in the arenas again, you know, they just like suck these, not you piece of shit, man. It's so good to be back.  I've missed you. Regardless, it appears we now have yet another breed of Karen. Yes. My friends, they're mutating faster than the coronavirus. And just like coronavirus Kerans are a huge drain on American society. Luckily for them and us now, there's a place where Kerans can go for treatments.  There's an epidemic in this country that's spiraling out of control.  Please don't come close to Papapetrou. Women across the country lashing out, flying off the handle, set off my problems.  Great and small, mostly small, you know, wearing a mask.  Can you step away? Can you show me your papers? I have a breathing problem. I have a flight to my pizza.  If you were someone you love exhibits these disturbing symptoms, there is hope. The Care intervention, virtual rehab clinic. We study and treat the root causes and behaviors of the caring and reintegrate them into society as fully functioning citizens who mind their own damn business.  You'll come to us, Acheron, but leave a Britney or Deniece or whatever your name was before, unless it was Karen, in which case you're going to have to change it no matter what type of terrorism you suffer from.  We can help. We specialize in a wide range of wild and out women, including Magga, Karen's drive through Caren's and even covid Kerans.  They will let me in without a mask, but it's my constitutional right to buy Froyo and cough on whoever I want to.  Karen, let's just try on a face mask, see how it feels.  Yeah, but I can't breathe.  You can breathe or you wouldn't be complaining so much. My faith has rights, but if all the parents we treat, I'm most proud of our work with racist kerans. Hi. Yes.  I'd like to report a black man who is trying to come in my door. He says he's a mailman. But can you please send somebody quick?  Karen, I'd like you to try some exposure therapy now. Roy, are you there? Hey, what's up?  Hey, this is my friend Roy. I just want you to watch him for a few minutes without losing your mind. Look, he's got a gun. It's a sandwich. Karen, can I go? Once you check in, our therapies will cut straight to the root of your Karenni. I think the manager that you really need to speak to is the one that's inside here.  Another breakthrough. Don't wait to seek help. Call us now. We know how good you are at whipping out your phone. Rehabilitation is possible. And I know that because I'm not just a counselor here, I'm also in recovery.  This coffee's cold. I'm calling the police. It was cold. Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, rising Republican star and the friend everyone ignores in the group text. Green is known for her history of deranged beliefs ranging from racist conspiracy theories about Jewish space lasers to supporting calls to execute Democratic politicians. Now, Democrats can't stop her from serving in Congress, and they definitely can't stop her from saying crazy shit. But today they decided to give her just a little less input on running the country.  Tonight, House Democrats taking an unprecedented step, voting to strip freshman Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, a member of the opposing party of her committee assignments. She's going to be removed from the House Education and Labor Committee, as well as the House Budget Committee. She's going to be a member of the House of Representatives for the next two years. But she's going to be a member without being able to serve on any of these committees. Yes, people.  Marjorie Taylor Green has been kicked off her committees. But if you think about it, this is a pretty sweet deal for Green. Basically, her punishment for acting insane was to do less work for the same amount of money. And honestly, I think kicking off these committees could actually backfire. The last thing you want to do with the crazy person is give them time to be crazy. That's why they should put her on all the committees. Then you'll never hear from her again.  Excuse me. When are we going to talk about those Jewish space lasers? Well, no. First, we need to discuss the budget for the asphalt acquisitions. Sharon, do you have the report? I don't know. Do I have time to report back? I'll come on. I didn't say that. That was Yashiro. So Democrats have made their position on Marjorie Taylor Green clear, but Republicans are a different story. While some prominent senators have spoken out against her.  House Republicans held a meeting last night when they decided to stick with her or at the very least, look the other way.  House Republicans hosted a marathon meeting overnight.  There's a lot of questions that have to be answered and we've got to be able to do that in a family meeting to help bring people back together.  Marjorie Taylor Green, who escaped any punishment yesterday over her very extreme views, including endorsing political violence and anti-Semitic falsehoods.  Sources say Greene was given a standing ovation from half of the members in the room after she expressed remorse for some of her past comments.  I think it would be helpful if you could hear exactly what she told all of us denouncing Kiwane. I don't know if I said right. I don't even know what it is any from the shootings. She said she knew nothing about lasers or all the different things that have been brought up about her.  Damn, Kevin McCarthy is a GOP hodgy. I didn't hear shit, didn't see shit, and I definitely don't know shit. She it's truly amazing that this guy acts like he doesn't even know what Cunanan is even after they tried to kill him. I mean, most people would have at least Googled them at that point. Like eventually Carol Baskin must have been like, OK, I'll bite. Who is this tag I can get? Because, I mean, I should figure this out.  Right? And it's not like these guys don't have the time to research conspiracy theories, because when it comes to Hunter Biden, they remember every word like it's the lyrics to their favorite song, The Bridges. My emails decrypted from the Delaware laptop have been verified by Tony BlueSky, but then ask them about the biggest right wing culture in the country.  And they're like, Oh, you know who I who I know, man, who can keep track of this stuff. But to be fair to Kevin McCarthy, he's far from the only Republican who'd rather look like a dumb ass than take a position on Marjorie Taylor Greene and her crazy beliefs, although some Republicans are a little smoother at it than others.  Newly elected senator, arch conservative from Alabama, Tommy Tuberville, tells CNN he doesn't know anything about the congresswoman because the bad weather kept him from reading the news.  Travel in this weather has been a little rough, looking at LIGNE news or whatever.  Really, he hasn't been looking at the news because the weather's been rough. I know it's Alabama, but is this dude getting his news by Stagecoach? It's been so stormy. The Pony Express hasn't made it out here with the latest tweets. Clearly, modern retailer Green has become a distraction and a liability for the Republican Party, which is maybe why she decided to step up on the floor of the House today and disavow many of her past insane beliefs.  When I started finding misinformation, lies, things that were not true in these. Q And on post, I stop believing it. School shootings are absolutely real.  And every child that is lost, those families mourn it. I also want to tell you, 9/11 absolutely happened so that I definitely want to tell you I do not believe that it's fake.  Who looks like someone started listening to the reasonable voices in her head, although this woman is so crazy that her saying that 9/11 happened makes me go wait, did it? But, hey, I'm glad that she's come around to the standard Republican belief that school shootings are real and that nothing should be done to stop them. But you may not want to give Green too much credit for disavowing these conspiracy, since it turns out she doesn't take responsibility for believing them in the first place.  What I did is I started looking at things on the Internet and I stumbled across something. And this is at the end of twenty seventeen called Kuhnen. I was allowed to believe things that weren't true and I would ask questions, questions about them and talk about them.  And that is absolutely what I regret, because if it weren't for the Facebook post and and comments that I liked in twenty eighteen, I wouldn't be standing here today and you couldn't point a finger and accuse me of anything wrong. Wow.  I've never seen someone try to delete their browser history in real life.  But yes, you see, it's all Facebook's fault for allowing her to believe in those things. So don't blame her. Blame Mark Zuckerberg with his social media lies in his space, lasers. And look, man, Marjorie Taylor Green isn't the first person to believe things that she read on the Internet. But her defense isn't really reassuring because basically what she's saying is, yes, up until now, I believe that school shootings were fake, 9/11 didn't happen, and that Jewish space lasers blew up California.  But that's only because I'm incapable of separating fantasy from reality.

It's like, let's make these conversations fun again.  Not not a lot of stick, but a whole lot of carrot, which is what we try to do with let's move. Let's not talk about not eliminating soda and soda is bad.  Let's talk about drinking more water. Right. Because if you drink more water by that very nature, you will drink less soda.  That doesn't make soda bad. We're just talking about drink a little more water. So, you know, we've had to learn how to balance that because even in the White House, we got criticized for having those conversations.  I mean, getting kids to eat healthy was a controversial. And people were like, how dare she? It's nanny state.  And I'm like, I. I thought we were like some like even, you know, sort of like what? What.  So, you know, you had to sort of be really strategic and how you talked about this so that people wouldn't feel like you were judging the very core of who they are. And that's the thing.  Food is personal, you know, and waffles and most moseyed address the notion that, you know, cultures are built on the food that they eat. You know, it's love, it's family. However you do it. It is. It's at the core of who we are. So you've got to be careful not to judge the way people do it. Just offer them different approaches, you know, open their minds and starting with kids who will bring their own curiosity.  I saw this dish cooked on the show. Can we try it? And you notice the cooking is done a lot on hot plates, in toaster ovens. You know, a lot of vegetables. It's accessible and that's for a reason. And the recipes are on the website along with the pasta, the love campaign, waffles and Mosig. So we're encouraging people to interact with the show through the website. And kids can earn their badges like Waffles and Motoki.  So, you know, again, our our goal is to make it fun.  Well, I think you're well on the way to achieving that goal, and I really hope that Postern love goes from a million to 10 million to one hundred million until there's no need to pass any more love.

Today is Monday, April 5th, and I hope everybody had a happy Easter. And I hope you also enjoyed a really nice Easter egg hunt. I actually haven't found my Easter eggs yet because my trick is I wait a few weeks until all of them start to rot and then the smell gives them away.  Pretty smart, anyway, coming up on tonight's show, America has a new creepiest congressman. He discovers why women are leaving the workforce and why Georgia Republicans are switching to Pepsi. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah. Here's a. Let's kick things off with an update on covid-19, the pandemic that's harder to get rid of than a serial killer in a hockey mask this past year sometimes felt like an endless repetition of Netflix, crofts and boring little walks around the neighborhood. Hell, I took so many walks, I started naming the fire hydrants.  It was going all Yellow Springs name. Yeah. Good to see you, Richard. Where's my money, Richard? I don't forget you told me you needed to buy new not to close the water hole. And you did I kill you, Richard? I don't forget. But now things are suddenly moving very fast in the right direction. The only question is, are they moving fast enough?  After a weekend of Easter gathering's and a record number of spring break travelers, the fear this morning. Another dangerous surge is looming. Michigan now seeing the country's largest spike in cases reporting its highest daily count since early December, while infections are rising in over 20 states. Health experts aren't in agreement that a fourth wave is imminent.  We will see in the next two weeks the highest number of cases reported globally since the beginning of the pandemic. I think that there's enough immunity in the population that you're not going to see a true fourth wave of infection. What we're seeing is pockets of infection around the country.  This as the vaccine rollout is picking up pace. The CDC says more than three million doses are now being distributed every day and over 18 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated.  That's right, people. America may be entering a fourth wave of coronavirus. This pandemic is getting more spinoffs than law and order. But the good news is, and I really mean this focus on the good news, the fourth wave might not be as big as earlier waves because so many people are being vaccinated. Yeah. So in many ways, it could end up being like when the wave comes around for the fourth time at a baseball game.  Right now, the problem is that we just don't know yet. Some experts are saying things are about to get worse and some experts are saying things are getting better. It actually makes it hard to know how cautious we should be. That's why I am not taking any chances. I have started licking doorknobs again. But just to be safe, I put a condom on them first. Basically, right now we're in a race between the people who are masking and getting vaccinated and the people who are spreading the virus.  When you think about it, that's been the question with every big issue in history. Well, the people solving the problem faster than the people causing the problem are the people fixing the climate going faster than the people changing it? All the people building sewage systems faster than the people shitting in the streets. All we produce in Cancun is fast enough to fight the gutsiness. We never make enough Cong's. Regardless, you want to be one of the people fixing the problem.  So please get vaccinated so that you can go back to living your life and keep your mask on so that you can stay safe. And because time is of the essence here, if you do see the coronavirus, you know what you're going to do. You've got to stall. Oh, hey, Korona, yeah, I know you want to come into my lungs, but before that I was just wondering, do you have any good podcasts you'd recommend?  Oh, wow. With serial killers. Oh, that's cool. And then like. Oh, so did I.  Yeah, that's right. I got the vaccine beatch.  But let's move on now to some political news.  Donald Trump may have lost the twenty twenty election, but that's only if you count all the votes against him. The good news, though, is that doesn't mean he walked away from the race empty handed.  Well, Trump supporters may have gotten or given more than they bargained for when they donated to his reelection campaign. And New York Times investigation found the people who thought they were sending a single donation were charged over and over again by his campaign operation and what the Times calls an intentional scheme to boost revenue. Recurring online donations were set up by default. Here is how that fine print disclaimer look. Take a look at this. It was buried. That tiny line at the bottom of the first yellow box calls for a weekly recurring donation.  Hundreds of thousands of people had money withdrawn without their knowledge, leading to a record amount of fraud claims against more than sixty four million bucks in refunds in the last months of twenty twenty.  The sixty three year old man willingly initially contributed five hundred dollars to the Trump campaign when the man who had his bank account repeatedly charged five hundred dollars several times in the weeks to come to the tune of three thousand dollars in less than 30 days.  God damn. Say what you want about Donald Trump, but this man is a legend, his last act as president was to rob his own supporters.  They loved him so much, they stormed the Capitol for him. And meanwhile, he was like, you go on ahead. I'll watch your stuff. Leave your wallet here, Bobby. I got you. What's most surprising to me is that Trump's base didn't expect this from him, because if you know Donald Trump at all, you should know that he will scam anyone. That's why even when Melania is at home, she still takes her purse with her to the bathroom.  I'm going people now. Credit card comes with me, Donald. Now, you probably think that after getting scammed, his supporters would have second thoughts about him. But it turns out some of the victims still say that they are loyal to Donald Trump. I mean, how far does he have to go for these guys to stop believing in him? Well, sure. I missed that check box to let Trump take my nose, but that's my fault.  I would still shake the man's hand. If I had a hand because I missed that checkbox to and finally there's another political story that we missed while we were off the air last week. And, you know, normally when we miss a political scandal, we just say a big deal and we wait for the next one because it's fine. Scandals about politicians come around more often than YouTube.  Apologies, but this story is so insane that we just have to talk about it.  Stunning new allegations that Florida Republican Matt Gates paid women for sex. The Justice Department is investigating whether the congressman in a local Florida politician gave cash or other items of value to multiple women who are recruited online to sleep with them. The men allegedly told women to meet at hotels and that some of the encounters reportedly involved the drug Ecstasy. The inquiry is also examining whether Gates had a sexual relationship with a 17 year old girl and possibly violated sex trafficking laws. Sources tell us that as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, female colleagues referred to him as, quote, creepy gates because he made them feel so uncomfortable once in Congress.  Sources say Gates allegedly boasted of his sexual encounters with women and would allegedly tried to show colleagues photos and videos of naked women. He'd claimed he'd slept with one source saying he tried to show him video of a naked woman with a hula hoop.  OK, this is crazy, Matt Gates, Florida congressman and only living relative of Beavis and Butthead being accused of sex crimes.  And there are a lot of different accusations happening here now, do I think that Matt Gates looks like a guy who shows photos of naked women to people at work? Yes, but do I think that he would have paid for sex? Yeah, definitely. But do I think that he's the kind of guy who would take ecstasy and have sex with an underage girl also? Yes. So really, there's only one question left for Gates. Does he deny all of the charges or does he admit to everything and just become king of Florida and not forget these allegations would be criminal no matter what.  But the fact that he's in Congress makes them even worse, because at what point in the day is he showing all of these nude videos? And that's why Americans should be free to choose their own health care. And speaking of free, check out these days, but let's move on to our main story, voting.  It's democracy's rose ceremony. Ever since last November's election, when Democrats turned out in large numbers, Republicans around the country have been working hard to make voting harder. And last week, the biggest voter restriction law just passed in one of the states with the results were the closest.  A new law signed by Georgia's governor, Brian Camp imposes a series of new restrictions on elections in the state.  Let's remind folks about what that law does. It shrinks the window for sending absentee ballots severely limits the number of ballot drop boxes and gives more control of local elections to state lawmakers who are majority Republican. It also makes it a crime to give water or food to people waiting in line to vote.  President Biden last week slammed the Republican backed law as sick.  When I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagles'.  Yeah, you tell him Biden. And then maybe explain what you just told him, because I have no idea what you're talking about, like, is he saying eagles are worse than crows? Like, are we all supposed to share his personal burden rankings because I don't know about you, but this is the most Joe Biden thing ever. He's trying to make a point about America's history of racist voting restrictions. And instead, he's got us arguing about birds.  Look, man, I agree. Eagles ought to go, but you can't be disrespecting the crow like that, man. You show me another bird that could use a tool to obtain food. She. But that's right. After losing in November, Georgia Republicans decided to basically make voting more like all of the worst parts of flying. OK, so there's going to be really long lines. No one can have water. And if you like, you can go yourself.  In fact, you know what? No shoes. Everybody take off your shoes. So obviously, a lot of people were upset about this law. Democrats were angry. Black people were angry. The president was angry. So for help, they turned to the only people whose opinions might actually count for something giant corporations.  More fallout now over the new voting law in Georgia. Major League Baseball pulled the all star game out of Atlanta. And over the weekend, the Braves covered up the all star patch on their uniform. MLB decision comes after civil rights groups put pressure on organizations and corporations to pull business out of Georgia.  Two major Georgia based companies, Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines, are now taking the same stance, arguing the Republican law was based on a lie and will restrict voting rights. Delta CEO Ed Bastian spoke to CBS This Morning. The right to vote is sacrosanct, and we can't do anything to send a message to people that we're going to make it more restrictive and harder to have their voice heard.  That's right. Corporate America has come out in force against Georgia's new laws. Delta and Coke spoke out. The MLB moved its All-Star Game and decided to film the next season of Atlanta in Alaska. Who paperboys not going to be happy. And look, it's great to see corporations use their influence and support of voting rights. But but just to be clear, they didn't do this out of the goodness of their hearts, right? They did it because liberals were threatening to boycott them if they didn't speak out.  And it's actually amazing what you can get companies to do when you threaten a boycott. I mean, just the threat of a boycott got Coca-Cola to back a voting rights group. Think about that. That means with just a little more pressure, we can probably convince Coke to put cocaine back in the drinks business people. But I guess I'm not surprised that they gave in because a lot of these companies aren't exactly in a great position to negotiate. Well, you can't boycott Delta Airlines because what are you going to do, fly a different airline?  Oh, yeah. Oh, well, when you put it that way, I guess we'll put out a statement. Now, here's the problem for these corporations. Any time they try to make one side of an issue, happy, people on the opposite side are going to get pissed off, which is exactly what happened next.  Georgia based companies are facing backlash from Republicans after expressing their dissatisfaction with that state's new voting law. Now, Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola have found themselves in a heated fight with Governor Brian Kemp after Delta's CEO Ed Bastian condemned the restrictive voting rights bill. Republicans in the state legislature are looking at increasing taxes on the company in retribution. A group of Georgia House Republicans is canceling Coca-Cola. They're saying Pepsi is OK after the company's CEO spoke out against the state's new restrictive voting law, asking for all Coke products to be removed from their offices.  GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted, quote, Guess what I am doing today? Not watching baseball, followed by four exclamation marks.  Former President Donald Trump is calling for conservatives to boycott corporations, saying it's finally time for Republicans and conservatives to fight back. Boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, Viacom, CBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS and Merck. The radical left will destroy our country if we let them. We will not become a socialist nation. Adding Happy Easter. OK, first of all, I love how he just threw Happy Easter in there. I mean, forget politics.  I think Trump needs to start a line of greeting cards. How Joe Biden's laptop exposes the whole Russia. The election was rigged and Batmitzvah. But more importantly, Trump has now called for boycotting the NFL and MLB. I mean, at this rate, pretty soon the only sport left for him to watch will be what soccer? And I actually think that he'll like it, especially the flopping. Mr. President, an important part of the sport is making it seem like your opponent did something wrong when in fact, they didn't.  It truly is the beautiful game. And honestly, you've got to feel for the GOP because they spend so much time defending corporate interests, trying to cut corporate taxes, letting corporations do whatever they want. And then the corporations are just like, cool, now we have more money to pay Colin Kaepernick. Not only that, Democrats are like, we will disband every corporation and make them pay.  And Coke and Delta are like, yes, queen slay us. But this is tough for these corporations to I mean, they really miss the old days, you know, when they didn't have to take sides on voting rights or culture wars. They just made dipoles out of asbestos and that was that. But these days, being a corporation means trying to navigate all these political issues without getting boycotted, which is not easy. But luckily, we have an idea for how they can avoid this problem altogether.  Here at Delta Airlines, we've heard your concerns. You want us to speak out against voter suppression and you want us to speak out for voter suppression."}]}

Hey, got any idea what I gandy dancer is where a phrenologists, what about a knocka upper believe it or not, these are all actual jobs from the past and the stories behind them are fascinating.  I'm that beat. And I'm Helen Hong. And every week we take a look at a different occupation that is now jobs elite on our new podcast called, you guessed it, Jobs Elite.  Check it out on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast.  No one wants a repeat of January 6th when a mob of the world's angriest aunts and uncles attacked the Capitol building, and we all watched the riots live on the news that day. But as time goes on, we're finding out that the situation was even crazier than we thought.  Plus, new details Tonight Show just how close the violence got to the vice president and his family as the mob chanted Hang Mike Pence and a makeshift gallows went up. The vice president, his wife and daughter were just seconds away from being spotted. According to The Washington Post, at one point, they were hiding less than a hundred feet from the violent crowd, attacking police officers, journalists and others.  And the chilling search for Speaker Nancy Pelosi is there inside the Senate chamber, Insurrection describes.  And then. While we're here, we might as well let's take a seat before. You know, I used to blame lawmakers for not getting anything done, but now I'm starting to think that maybe it's the Capitol building that jams up Congress because you see this mob, they came in with the goal to overthrow the government. But then once they got and they were like, yeah, let's throw this thing. You know what? Maybe we should vote on something.  I don't know. Let's actually, guys, let's adjourn for the day. We'll come back tomorrow and we couldn't get anything done. And if you didn't believe it before, this is how you really know that Trump's supporters are a cult because they wanted to hang Mike Pence for finally accepting the election results. Mike Pence, people. No one has been more loyal to Trump than Mike Pence. While Trump was screwing America over the last four years, Mike Pence was gently guiding his hips from behind.  Not you calling him a traitor.  Mike Pence. And I know people don't like him, but I, for one, am really glad that this mob didn't hurt Mike Pence because I think we could all agree that no one should have to die a virgin. Now, since that day, the FBI has rounded up over hundred and thirty people so far for taking part in the assault on the Capitol. And if you're wondering how on earth did they find all these people? Well, it turns out it was all on the ground.  The man posing beneath the sign above Nancy Pelosi's office is a firefighter from Florida, Andy Williams. We're all trying to get in to the Capitol to stop this. A corporate lawyer from Dallas, Paul Davis, posted this video and was quickly identified by his boss, Nicholas Rodin, for his work I.D. badge around his neck.  This man posted a selfie smoking a cigarette with the caption hello from the Capitol.  Lowell, the man who put his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desk is 60 year old Richard Barnat, known as Bigo.  That left no doubt says he was. In this fella, Derek Evans, live stream, the moment he and other members of the mob broke into the Capitol and out of the Capitol. No, guys, guys, you can't be serious has really gotten this bad that social media has poisoned us to the point where we're going to live stream our treason. Of how some people were like, this is our seventeen seventy six. Yeah. Guys, you didn't see George Washington crossing the Delaware like I do declare Selfe.  I will say, though, this is an argument for defunding the police because you don't need billions of dollars for detectives when you can find criminals just by scrolling your Instagram Discover page. So after four years, President Trump is spending his last days in power, like many tinpot dictators, convincing his most rabid fans to keep fighting for a lost cause while he hides in a bunker somewhere. But whether you hate Trump or whether you just mildly dislike him, you have to admit a few things about this man.  No. One, he has changed American politics forever. For starters, the red phone in the Oval Office will always call McDonald's instead of the Pentagon. That's not going to change. Also, he's completely dropped the ball for presidential behavior. I mean, in 10 years, a president could be in the middle of a press conference and everyone will just be like, huh? I guess he just had to go. Also, you got to admit that Trump, from the time he ran for president, he's been consistent know the victimhood and the racial resentment that came down that escalator in twenty fifteen.  Well, those are the same that ended up at the Capitol on January 6th. And because Trump has been so consistently bad, because he's been so consistent that being himself, he's exposed how bullshit so many other people are. For instance, Fox News, they spent all of twenty twenty screaming that blue lives matter. The way Fox News defended police during the George Floyd protests, you would have thought that opposing police brutality was the same thing as killing police. But then when their people stormed the Capitol and police at the Capitol were beaten and actually killed, two officers were actually killed.  All of a sudden, Fox News is saying this.  These are not conspiracy theorists motivated just by lies. That's a bunch of nonsense that people want to tell us. These are people that understand first principles. They love freedom and they love free markets. And they see exactly what the anti-American left has done to America.  And so many of them are just patriotic, well loving Americans who are frustrated that their institutions of government, of media have let them down a lot as people not dispossessed.  They're not some creepy androgenous blogger who shows up to burn things down. They're like kind of solid Americans.  I get it now. These people weren't creepy bloggers. They were solid, law abiding Americans. And nobody is allowed to kill cops except for the people who respect cops. They can do whatever they want. Also, where the hell did they love free markets come from? Free markets. I wasn't picking that up when people were smashing windows and breaking the capital down to free markets, free markets are not something that drives a riot. No one's ever slapped someone over a free market before, much less murdered a police officer.  Look, man, the point is, you guys clearly don't care about cops. You only care about the idea of using cops to keep black people in their place. So please miss me with that bullshit. Also, Lindsey Graham, whether you're a liberal or conservative, everyone should agree that this asshole, this Cracker Barrel mascot, is a weasel, the worst weasel of any kind, because after the Capitol was stormed off to the Capitol as stormed and it looked like Trump was done, he gave a big speech about how he was done supporting Trump because Trump took it too far.  He just took things too far out now.  But then the next week, he was suddenly flying on Air Force One again because he realized Trump wasn't out. And then he started blaming the attack on the Democrats.  Senator Lindsey Graham placing blame for the Capitol Hill riot on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Watch this.  What happened on January the 6th was one of the low points in my time in office. It was horrendous to see people come take over the Capitol, the House and the Senate, beat officers, defile the seat of government. Had the hell could that happen? Where was Nancy Pelosi? It's her job to provide capital security.  Yeah. Nancy, why weren't you in your office when people were coming to kidnap or kill you? What were you hiding yourself?  Oh, we got Nancy. We gotcha. What did Lindsey Graham expect Nancy Pelosi to do, huh? Set up booby traps in the Capitol like an old age home alone. Please, please miss me with this bullshit.  And this also goes out to all those Republicans who spent four years backing a president who called his opponents un-American and enemies of the people, but now now that he's getting impeached and might be held accountable. Oh, all of a sudden it's time to move on.  Today is a moment for members of Congress to put aside partisan politicking and place people over power.  We should be focused on bringing the nation together. We must be bigger and better than the most basic of instincts that have been driving our political discourse. It is destroying us.  Let's link arms with one another and begin to heal.  Does not matter if you are liberal, moderate or conservative. All of us must resist the temptation of further polarization. As history shows, unity is not an option. It's a necessity.  OK, I don't know what crazy ass world you people grew up in, but how are you going to start a fight and then tell everyone else to calm down? Can you imagine if a terrorist tried to hijack a plane and then after the marshal tackled him, he says, OK, OK, I think everyone needs to calm down. Let's just come together and watch the rest of crude's. All right, let's do this together.  I'm going to have the chicken think the movie. All these people who try to overthrow the government feel they can miss me with that bullshit, and it's not just FOX, it's not just Republicans, social media companies.  For years, people have been warning you about the violence and conspiracy that you've been amplifying and allowing to spread on your platforms. And for years, you've said you can't do anything about it.  But now that the capital has been ransacked, now all of a sudden it turns out you can now that the violence happened, we're going to do everything we can to stop the violence from happening.  I mean, I don't know if I'm the only one, but I think it's really funny how social media companies said that they don't have a magic button to stop hate online. But then when Trump lost, suddenly they were like, oh, we do have that button. Here it is. So what now? These companies want a cookie for doing the right thing. Too late. Missed me with that bullshit. I will say, though, it was funny that random apps that had nothing to do with Trump also decided to pile on the Trump in like when Spotify and Pinterest banned Donald Trump.  What was that for? What it's part of I think that Trump was going to release a mixtape. What's the printers been for? Is Trump going to put a border wall?  Images on his page, although it would be funny if Spotify was actually the thing that broke Donald Trump's hearts, like if he was just sitting there like, I don't care that they blocked my Twitter or my Instagram or Facebook, I've still got my Spotify.  Look, man, here's the thing. By this time tomorrow, Donald Trump will be out of power. And I just hope I hope that he slowly fades away like one of his tens. And I know that he'll never fully be gone. All right. He's basically the conservative politics. America is going to be experiencing side effects long after he's out of the system. And unfortunately, we're probably going to see mutated strains as well.  But I do hope that with him at least not being president, we can all get back to being a bit more honest with each other and more nuanced in how we talk about what divides us. That's my wish for the next year because I don't know what twenty twenty one is going to bring, but if it involves any bullshit, I kindly request that I've missed. Today, the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and McDonald's share price in Florida just went way up because America just got a brand new dad.  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., do solemnly swear. I, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute. That I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States. Office of President of the United States. And will, to the best of my ability, well, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States Constitution of the United States.  So help you God. So help me God. Congratulations, Mr. President. I don't know about you, but this moment will stay in my memory forever. Joe Biden's middle name is Robinett Watt, but that's right.  As of noon Eastern Time today, America welcomed the fresh young face of Joseph R. Biden as its forty sixth president. And despite the pandemic, this inauguration had it all former presidents, the youngest inaugural poet, an amazing singer wearing her own Etsy store, an old man on his way to the post office, and even a lady whose outfit just called me a broken bitch. Biden was so committed to unity that he even invited enemies of the state. No, I'm joking.  I'm joking, guys. I'm joking. Ted Cruz didn't try and overthrow the government. He just supported the people who did. Even Mike Pence attended the inauguration to honor the democratic transition of power. Kudos to Mike Pence. You can see him there with his mosque featuring the vice presidential seal. And as tradition dictates, once Comilla was sworn in, he gave that very same mosque for her to put on it. But before the new president could walk in, the old one had to be kicked out.  There you see Marine One on the lawn of the White House. President Trump still there, but as expected, depart any minute for Andrews Air Force Base and give a final speech before heading tomorrow.  I can tell you that from the bottom of my heart, this has been an incredible four years. We rebuilt the United States military. We created a new force called Space Force, and now the stock market is actually substantially higher than it was at its highest point prior to the pandemic. So it's really you could say we built it twice. I hope they don't raise your taxes. But if they do, I told you so. So just a goodbye.  We love you. We will be back in some form. Have a good life. We will see you soon.  Have a good life. That's not what a departing president is supposed to say. That's what you tell your best friend in high school when she starts dating your ex. I hope you two are very happy together. Have a good life. Obviously, before prom. I told you so, although I do like how he said he'll be back in some form because my man knows you got to leave on a cliffhanger. I'll be back in some form. Maybe I'll come back as a politician, maybe as a mutant fish monster, or maybe I'll come back as one of those old guys with a ponytail.  Stay tuned for Trump's last day in office. Wasn't all just whining and stealing silverware. No, my friends, he also made sure to hand out some very nice parting gifts to all his friends.  President Trump announces more than one hundred and forty pardons and commutations.  The list ranges from the president's political allies to nonviolent drug offenders. Steve Bannon pleaded not guilty to defrauding donors in a fundraising campaign for President Trump's border wall. But before the trial could even get underway, the president gave him a preemptive pardon. Three former Republican congressmen and commuted the sentence of Detroit's former Democratic mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving time on corruption charges. The president also pardoned rappers Lil Wayne and Chodak Black on their separate federal weapons related offenses.  That's right, people. Donald Trump pardoned a ton of shady people in the last hours of his presidency, which means those fraudsters can get back to defrauding and Steve Bannon can get back to selling music. The weird part, though, was how he kept trying to give prison time to Eric. I'm sorry, Eric. The rule in prison is one in one that is just like the nightclubs.  I'm going to miss you, Eric. Jokes have a good life. Now, what was really crazy is that Trump pardoned Chodak Black and Lil Wayne, which sounds like a good thing. I mean, it's cool to pardon anyone, I guess, but it's a terrible thing to do to a rapper because you're taking away their street cred."}]}

I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Today is Tuesday, March twenty third, which means it's officially spring time, baby. Yep. That time of the year when I go outside and enjoy that sweet, fresh air despite my allergies.  Oh, here it comes.  Anyway, coming up on tonight's show, we look at some actual good things going on in the world, what Hollywood gets wrong about the female orgasm. And Eric Andre joins us to talk about punishing America and his brand new movie. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah here every day on The Daily Show.  We cover the News Daily Show. And if you follow the News Daily, you know that most of it is bad and some days it's even more badder.  And it's on those days that I like to remind myself that there is still a lot of good out there in the world, and I'd like to share that good news and our ray of sunshine. Our first ray of sunshine is for dogs, creators of the world's most popular sex position across the country. There are thousands of good boys just waiting to be adopted, and one equally good human boy is giving them a boost.  A 14 year old found a way to help a lot of shelter dogs. His name is Dariusz Brown and helps them stand out in the crowd with bow ties. Dariusz, so hundreds of bow ties and sent them to animal shelters across the country looking sharp. And they aren't just for dogs because he makes them for cats, too. There you go. He says he's donated about six hundred bow ties for animal shelters. Shelter workers say it helps the animals, especially older ones, get noticed more quickly.  Very smart. Yeah.  Oh, guys. A bow tie on a dog. That's something you don't expect. You know, it's like shrimp tails and cinnamon toast crunch, but adorable. And this is a genius plan because a bow tie just makes everything a little snazzier. You know, dogs, people on the bow ties. A simple bow tie could even make like a raging douche bag seem respectable, which is, by the way, how Tucker Carlson got a TV show. The only problem is you'll never know why the dog has a bow tie on.  I mean, is it fashion or did that dog join the Nation of Islam? Some old nice white ladies going to bring her dog home, like speak, sparkie, speak, speak. Oh, what a surprise. The white devil wants me to speak on command. Moving on to the coronavirus vaccine. That's the only thing on earth that stone-Cold of independence. Every day, more and more people are vaccinated. But after a year of being extremely cautious, some people can't quite bring themselves to accept the good news because it's been so long.  I mean, even when I smile, I'm like, oh, no, my frown turned upside down. Is that a covered symptom? So here's a ray of sunshine about a grandmother who is still anxious about doing what she could after getting vaccinated and how her doctor helped to overcome it.  Some people say the best medicine is love for one woman in the Bronx. That's just what the doctor ordered. Take a look at this prescription. This is what Evelyn Shah got. It reads, You are allowed to hug your granddaughter. It comes after both of them were fully vaccinated.  My daughter and granddaughter came to my apartment because they had a gift to me. To my amazement was a prescription from my doctor.  And she wrote, You are allowed to hug your granddaughter.  That is a hug I'm going to remember forever.  OK, you got to admit, this is such a heartwarming story. I mean, unless we find out that that's the doctor's treatment for everything, I'm afraid it's lupus.  So what you're going to need to do is go and hug this woman's grandma right away. Twice a day now, yes, it is true that the doctor was out of network, so that hug will cost eighty thousand dollars, but I'm still happy that this grandma got to see her family before she files for medical bankruptcy and actually really shows you how much people respect the authority of doctors. I mean, once they write a prescription, there's no more arguing.  It's a prescription. Oh, doctors could make that work for them to shit if I was a doctor, I'd just go into a bank with my prescription pad. Good afternoon. I have a prescription for you here that says you need to open the safe and hand me all the cash.  Well, I guess if it's for my health now, look, until everyone can get vaccinated, it is still important to monitor the spread of the coronavirus so we can stop any outbreaks before they get too far. And now getting a coronavirus test is going to be easier than ever.  Door Dash will soon be delivering at home covid tests across the United States.  The delivery apps teaming up with two health companies, Vault Health and Everleigh. Well in 12 US market Doorjambs says delivery of the FDA approved test kits will typically take less than an hour.  They cost us over one hundred dollars each and they can return results in twenty four to forty eight hours.  Yes, Bardash. You can now get a covid test delivered right to your home along with, I'm assuming 40 packets of ketchup and don't ask isn't the only one helping. By the way, UBA has started offering covid tests to. Yeah. If you get in the car and you can smell weed you just tested negative my friend. Congrats. And let me just remind everybody right now that your delivery driver is not responsible for your test results because, you know, there are people out there who are going to base their reviews on that.  What you're telling me that I have covid dude, one star bitch. I'm not the one who coughed on you. Moving on to a ray of sunshine from the world of racism. Yeah, even racism. Black people in America have been waiting for slavery reparations for one hundred and fifty years. And to put that in terms white people can understand, that's even longer than you've been waiting for the next Game of Thrones book. Now, residents of one city are finally getting their first taste.  The nation's first reparations program for African-Americans was approved overnight in Illinois. The Chicago suburb of Evanston is moving forward with a 10 million dollar plan to address a history of discriminatory housing practices faced by its black residents. The first step, which passed last night, makes four hundred thousand dollars available for home ownership grants and mortgage assistance. This plan could become a model that more cities could follow.  That's right. People reparations are happening. With these housing grants. Black Americans can finally fulfill their lifelong dreams of gentrifying a white neighborhood.  And kudos to Evanston, Illinois, especially since I assume whoever the Evans guy the city was named after was a huge racist. In fact, let me check that before I assume that some Wikipedia out and. Yep, huge racist. Here's my thing, though. It's great that some of the funding is going towards practical things like aiding homeownership. But keep in mind, black people have been through a lot of shit in America over the last four hundred years.  So some of that money should also just be to give black people a good time, you know, help them relax, like going to the spa or getting a facial or buying a stressful for want of a Kanye West tweet something. Basically what I'm saying is it's not real reparations unless you give the descendants of slavery actual money and let them choose how they want to spend it as if they were adults.  But still, congratulations to the black people of Evanston and congratulations to all the white people who are going to find a way to game the system. Well, my twenty three and me says that I'm actually three percent Africa. So and finally, some uplifting animal news. Like most of us, zoo animals have been stressed out by the coronavirus. Lockdown's stuck in their homes for a whole year and they don't even have Netflix.  I mean, imagine being a tiger and not getting to watch Tiger King. That's the ultimate flomo.  But now a zoo in Colombia is giving it stressed out residents a musical treats.  Colombia's Caleigh Zoo hired a pianist to help relax its animals. On Saturday, Mario Fernando Prado came to the zoo and played some of the most popular classical songs for animals ranging from zebras, lions to flamingos. Prieto says this was certainly a different from his usual gigs. The zoo said Prado was their debut artist and helped pave the way for other musical acts.  And I'm so jealous right now. Right now.  That is a beautiful idea. And I'm actually sure that this was very relaxing for all of the animals. Although you can't tell by looking at an ostrich, you know, you can't see when that animal is relaxed. Just has one facial expression, which is always realizing you left your phone in a cab. And as an added bonus for the zoo, a piano concert is probably going to keep all the zebras in line. Can you imagine them during that performance?  They were looking at those black and white keys, like, what have they done to Jimmy?  They've cut them up and now they're making music come out of his body.  Just because you kidnapped the zebras from Africa and keep them in Colombia doesn't mean they're not African anymore. So, look, I think this was great for everyone. I mean, the only person I feel a little bad for is the piano player.  This probably wasn't the career that he dreamt of when he started playing the piano.  Mama, you remember how you said I would never make it as a musician? Oh, my God, Eduardo, did you make it into the Philharmonic?  What? No wrong number. OK, never mind. Bye bye. Now say what you want, but this story is adorable. And you, who loves adorable stories, is my friend Roy Junior. I want to bring him on right now. You're right, what's going on, my man, what's going on? You Bamburgh, I know you love playing piano, so I wanted to see if you heard the story of the pianist who got a gig playing for zoo animals.  Yeah, I heard about it.  Trash hated the story I hate to do, but boy, I thought of all people. You would think it's cute. Oh, I like it, Trevor.  I also auditioned for the gig. Then they decided to go with some guy playing Mozart. Mozart. Oh, wow.  So you auditioned to play piano for zoo animals? Well, why wouldn't I? It's a sweet job. You get to work outside, you get free parking, you get all the stale peanuts, the elephants don't eat. And I wrote all these great original songs for the animals with the zookeepers. The zookeepers decided my songs weren't appropriate. Wow.  Roy, I'm man, I'm sorry for that, brother. Like, I'm sorry that they didn't like your music.  And it is what it is, man. I had some good hits, man. Check check this out. This is good songs, man. Hey, the. Well, you got to eat all of the zookeeper's rise up, it gets you a press. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.  Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. That's that's what you was singing. You can't you can't sing that. You can't be telling the animals to eat the zookeepers. Now that's that's promoting violence.  Do the words I was singing is just nonsense. I'm just gonna say the words for rhythm. You know, the animals can't understand English.  Well, actually, that's a that's a good point. That's not like you like telling that. Yeah, no, I play on my bad my bad mouth.  What was what was that man. Come on. Like, you know, you understand English. I've been teaching you in secret for several months this week. Part of the. Next to the game break down. OK, Roy, Esterline champion. Yeah, I think that's part of the problem that Roy, you see, I understand that zoos have ethical problems, but you can't be you can't be telling the lions to go and eat, like why you even do.  What are you planning? Planning? Don't be so paranoid.  Trevis. Just it. He likes. School children today know what I do know about. And I'll take you to his house and you can eat everyone except me and I'll be the king, the lion eat me to. That would not be nice, but that's a problem for Lee. I'm glad they didn't take your songs that the Zuman know. Because you, son, is shit, that's why to me and eating me, as was all of you, music is trash, that's Krubera, then I could get mad about it.  But you know what? I've been working on myself. I'm willing to bury the hatchet. So let's talk about it tomorrow. Meet me at noon. At what?  No, I'm not going to meet you. I know what you're planning, Roy. You want me to come to the zoo so I can sing these songs with you? I'm not stupid, Roy. Get out of here, Roy. Junior, everybody is not going to get me that easy. All right. We're going to take a short break.  But first, if you're a college basketball bracket is as busted as everyone else's is, it's not too late to go all the way in The Daily Show's brackets of bullshit where you can vote for the little things that have annoyed you the most during the pandemic, because I know it's been a legitimately terrible year, but let's be honest, it would have been a lot of trivial problems that we didn't need on top of the really bad stuff, you know, like celebrity singing imagine or emails that start with in these difficult times so annoying.  I think that one could actually go all the way round two is open now. So go to Daily Show bracket dot com and make your picks.

Struggles in Angola, you know, is that is he is connecting the dots, you know, when I was like his points of references like Jomo Kenyatta, you know, it's like you and you can go on that kind of rabbit hole and go down there and find out all the stuff that's happening there in terms of how to battle what's happening here and what sometimes what pitfalls to look out for overthrowing.  Actually, you're just replacing what was there with a with a black face. And that is the issue is capitalism, you know. Yes. And so it's understanding and understanding that he he they saw it as a big as a macro point of view, you know, and it's what they saw is this is a Western construct that's kind of a Western virus was like, you know, it's like it's like a pandemic.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the beginning of a Trevor Noah podcast about Conspiracy Theories - Born in America Compilation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're listening to Comedy Central. Now, my dad talks to me, but not in the way humans do. She uses body language to word how she's feeling. That's why I hate to see her with low energy or excessively scratching. So to make sure my dog is feeling well. I give her fresh factors from springtime natural supplements. She's older and age, but with fresh factors. She still has that puppy spirit. If you love your dog, listen to them with fresh factors.  My dog only tells me good things like running, jumping and wagging her tail. Right, Sandy, go to springtime dotcom to receive free shipping and learn how you can save up to 50 percent. Once we get out of this, once this is all done, we can finally leave the house and do normal things like tongue kiss our Uber drivers. There's going to be one question, one question that people want an answer to more than anything. Where in the hell did this disease come from?  Because before the virus shut down the world, people will happy people will happy to accept the official explanation from China, which was that the virus originated at a live animal market where it's somehow jumped from a bat to a human. And we were like, OK, I think that's the plot of dark night, but we'll accept it.  But now now that all of us have been stuck in the house with nothing to do except throw our cat's birthday parties of a zoo, everyone, everyone at home has had time to come up with some theories about how exactly they think this whole thing went down. Now, I've also been spending a lot of time online, and the most common conspiracy theory I've seen is that the virus jumped from a bat to a human the same way Oriels jumped from packaging into my roommate's mouth.  And with it going, Billy, I see you. And this is a theory many people willing to accept because of racism. People are saying that in China they eat all kinds of crazy things. Hey, I heard they eat cookies with a piece of paper inside. I was also ready to believe this pandemic could have started as a food thing because, look, man, I've been I've been in situations where food starts a thing like I was on a flight once where one person eats a tuna sandwich, but then we all paid the price.  So the story made sense until it came out that those viral videos of people eating that soup weren't even filmed in China. Yeah, and then we found out that viruses can't survive cooking anyway. So that was out the window. Then I heard about a different conspiracy theory. That totally makes sense. You see, it turns out Corona was never just a virus. No, it was actually a weapon created to take old people out.  If you go online, there's no shortage of conspiracy theories. All right. So here's one. The virus was bioengineered in a lab by scientists to be used as a weapon or a form of population control.  This is a theory former politician Bronwyn Bishop has also suggested it is to get rid of non-productive Chinese in the Chinese community, in the words of George Bernard Shaw, who should be eliminated so they don't have to be thieves.  Roseanne Barr is calling the novel coronavirus pandemic a ploy to kill baby boomers.  You know what is normal? I think they're just trying to get rid of all of my generation.  All right. Now, this theory, this theory made complete sense. Who dies the most from the virus? Old people. Who dies the most anyway? Old people, bam. It's the perfect crime. And think about it. As soon as people started saying, OK, Buma, all of a sudden we got coronavirus and old people are dying, there can't be a coincidence. And you might be asking, oh, why would anyone why would anyone want to take out all the old people?  I don't know. Maybe it's because someone was tired of giving up their seat on the bus. Maybe restaurant owners are just tired of having to open for dinner at three p.m. Maybe young people were just tired of getting their ass whipped at Bingol. The point is the motive is there. Now, I will admit, as much as I wanted to believe that theory, I had to let it go, OK? Because a team of scientists, scientists with degrees and qualifications, they sequenced the genome of the coronavirus.  They broke it down and they found that unlike everybody in Miami, this virus definitely wasn't manmade. So, OK, maybe this wasn't a biological weapon designed to destroy the slot machine economy. But that wasn't my favorite theory anyway, because there's one theory, one theory that actually makes the most sense. And it was this there's a conspiracy theory sweeping the globe, that coronavirus is caused by 5G technology.  The theory is that 5G damages the human immune system. All of us should know what's taking place right under our noses.  What 5G action actually does, it absorbs oxygen. And that's really important to know.  5G get switched on. People drop like flies and all of a sudden you've got the excuse because, well, there's a virus going on.  Some people in the UK bought into it so much they started lighting cell phone towers on fire. 5G burning, burning, burning out of control.  Yes. From those cell phone towers, though, we got to put an end to coronavirus and all group chats. I don't know how any of you people, but I did not ask to be a part of this group. Now, I know some of you are sitting at home right now smug, like how does thug cause a virus? That is. But I'll tell you how. Ask yourself this question. What is 5G? It's a superfast network that runs through the air.  You know, what else goes to the core of virus? What else goes through the supermarket? And what burger did I eat while watching the last Superman movie? Five guys, five guys, five G. I rest my case now.  I'm not going to lie.  There are a few coverage gaps in this 5G theory. Just a few. Just a few things that make me doubt. For starters, every part of this theory is completely ridiculous and biologically impossible. Not to mention coronavirus has also exploded in places where they don't even have 5G. So I haven't figured that out yet. And 5G, just like 4G and 3G before it is broadcast at such a low frequency, it's too weak to do any damage to you.  Yeah. So saying 5G makes you sick is sort of like saying an iPhone flashlight gave you a sunburn. In fact, 5G broadcast in the same range as a normal radio. Yeah. And let's be honest, the most dangerous thing we've gotten from a radio wasn't a virus.  It was mumbler number five. And that only killed, what, six thousand people, tops. So when did the coronavirus come from? I don't know. You have said it. I don't know. But I'll tell you this. I don't care if any of these conspiracy theories have been debunked. I'm not taking any chances. From now on, I will no longer be ordering the Papy spicy bat sandwich, even though it's delicious. I also decided I'm not going to get old.  It's just too risky. And most importantly, I've stopped using cell phones, yet no 5G for me from now on, I only use a pager and yeah, no, that makes it harder to send nudes, but I'm going to do my best. And I know the alternative to all of this is that I could just wait for doctors and scientists to figure out where this virus came from. But I mean, come on, man, I'm not crazy.  If you know anything about Kulen, you've probably heard that it's a conspiracy theory, but the truth is it's more like a political cult built around a conspiracy theory and then crossed with a big book of Woodstock puzzles.  And if that sounds complicated, well, wait till you hear what they believe in for believers.  Q is an anonymous government official who post classified information about a covert battle between the president and a malicious ring of celebrities, political elites and the so-called deep state.  This anonymous poster who was giving secret clues about becoming, quote, Great Awakening.  The central theme here is that Hillary Clinton and many of the world's other politicians and celebrities are members of a murderous child sex ring.  Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks and others eat children in order to extract a life extending chemical from their blood group.  They believe that a group of military generals recruited President Trump to break up this conspiracy and end their control of the government and the media.  Donald Trump and the Cuban on view is going to save us from this in a moment called The Storm.  His tweets are misspelled for a reason and when he does campaign. The smoking gun, it's all code for what is this telling us? OK, I want whatever these people are smoking because Trump's typos are a secret message. Man, I wish people would this forgiving when I did stupid shit. No, you guys don't get it. When Trevor threw up at that party, he was showing us it's what's on the inside that counts. But look, this guy's also not wrong.  President Trump's tweets are misspelled for a reason, and that reason is. He can't read. Now, look, if Hillary and Oprah were eating children to live longer, I would be horrified because that is such a waste of magic blood. You feed those kids to Ruth Bader Ginsburg people priorities, but there's no ways this conspiracy theory is actually true. And look, I believe a lot of crazy shit, OK? I believe the TSA confiscates all our lotion in order to secretly sell it back to us at Walgreen's.  I believe possums are just dogs that make I believe no one has actually ever broken up with me. They've just all been abducted by aliens. But this conspiracy theory is crazy, even for conspiracy theories.  I mean, set aside everything else you're telling me Trump is doing something heroic, but instead of taking credit for it, he's keeping it a secret. That is the most unbelievable thing I have ever heard. Plus, if you're wondering how it's possible that Trump can be leading the fight against the paedophile ring when he was friends with Jeffrey Epstein for years as well, according to Q, Trump has been undercover since the 90s, which I believe I mean, if there's one thing Trump is known for, it's his famously long attention span.  So how did this insane theory take off? Well, partly it latched on to fears about the real phenomenon of human trafficking, partly in fear of ancient anti Semitic tropes about elitists who drink the blood of children. But mostly it was just the good old Internets.  Kuhnen first emerged in the months after President Trump took office, starting on fringe Internet message boards before spreading to social media.  The pandemic has only made things worse. And so these people are just there all day. Facebook groups have grown exponentially with Kuhnen.  In just four months, membership of the biggest Public Cuneen groups rose by 700 percent.  We saw a lot of groups who were wellness communities, people who were interested in alternative health. People would the algorithm would sort these people together with the Cuban people. They would say alternative health. Maybe they're into antibiotics. If they're anti vax, maybe they're into Donald Trump. And within one or two clicks, people would go down these very bad paths. Yep.  That's how the shit always goes on the it feels like at this point the entire purpose of Facebook is to funnel everyone towards the craziest conspiracy theories possible because people will join a group about cycling and then five hours later, they're like, Hillary Clinton is a mountain goat people.  She's an actual girl.  And it's not surprising that the pandemic turned out to create the perfect conditions for people to get radicalized. Some people join Kuhnen, some people ordered Pelton's, and nine of them will shut up about it. This also shows you how much the Internet is ruining our brains. When Shakespear was quarantined during the plague, he was like, maybe I should write King Lear. And now people are sitting around during coronavirus going, I wonder if I could prove that Tom Hanks has sex with the devil.  Either way, starting from the swampy parts of the Internet, Kuhnen gradually picked up followers and eventually grew into a major online movement. And it hasn't seemed to matter that many of the things it predicted over the years just never came true.  Early on, they were claiming that Robert Mueller was secretly investigating and not to indict the cabal of Democratic leaders. And then President Trump was secretly working with Mueller's team. President Trump was secretly created a police force, by the way, to arrest them and force them to wear ankle bracelets.  The belief is that somehow the late JFK Jr. is alive and helping Trump clean up the deep state.  Nearly all of these clues, including that Hillary Clinton was arrested, turn out to be wrong. But the batting average doesn't seem to matter.  You can present them with evidence. You can demonstrate how the predictions have gone wrong and they don't seem to care. It's just again and again that Q is bigger than anything that they can be presented. But to the contrary. That's right.  It doesn't matter how many of Kyuss outlandish predictions fail to pan out, it never seems to have an impact on the movement. And that, my friends, is the classic sign of cult behavior. Once you're invested enough in something, you will make any excuse for its failures. So please don't be looking for logic here. That's not how cults work, OK? Cults don't follow logic. They follow whatever the cult tells them. That's why you always see cult leaders go so quickly from the sacred.  Aliens have chosen us to weird news guys. The sacred aliens told me I should bang all of your wives. I guess it must be for our redemption or something to go somewhere I pick her. So thanks to this religious fervor, Kuhnen took over the Internet and it would have been fairly harmless if it had just stayed on the Internet. You know, like Momoh. Nothing was a joke was.  That was weird, but the scary thing about Kuhnen is what happened when A jumped from the screen to the streets.  This is not just a bunch of online crazy talk. It's dangerous in real life.  The FBI says Kuhnen in there. Many conspiracy theories are a potential domestic terrorism threat. The North Carolina man who shot up this D.C. pizza restaurant looking for nonexistent pedophiles believed in similar theories.  On more than one occasion, people believed to be followers of Kuhnen have shown up, sometimes with weapons in places that the character told them were somehow connected to anti Trump conspiracies. In June, a man armed with a rifle and a handgun drove an armored vehicle to the Hoover Dam on what he said was a mission from Kuhnen cutdown.  Followers have allegedly been involved in a foiled presidential assassination plot. The devastating California wildfire, an armed standoff with local law enforcement officers in Arizona in July.  A twenty four year old man was charged in the shooting death of a reputed mob boss. His attorneys argued he was motivated by Kuhnen written on his hand in the courtroom where Kuhnen symbols.  You cannot be serious. Can you imagine being a mob boss and you get whacked by a kid from a message board? Not a rival, just some random kid. You almost want them to line your obituary and say you were a snitch.  But this is insane. KUMALO When people out in the world doing real things, shootings, hijackings, kidnappings, of all the bad advice I've gotten on the Internet, nothing ever came close to making me murder a mob boss. The worst advice I ever got was to use toothpaste to get rid of pimples. But I ate the entire tube of toothpaste. All I got was a tummy ache. Pimples didn't go anywhere. And even with sporadic real world violence, it might be tempting to dismiss Kuhnen as just another lunatic fringe.  But it's actually becoming pretty close to mainstream.  In fact, there are roughly 50 Kuis supporters who ran for office in the Republican Party this year, and it's almost certain that one of them is actually going to be in Congress next year, although maybe that's a good thing."}]}

We talked about her new Netflix show, changing the conversation around eating healthy and how the White House years have prepared her for lockdown.  Michelle Obama, welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.  It's my first time being on your show. It's just, you know, I'm sad that it's not in face to face or in person, but I'm glad I am.  I'm sad. I'm sad, too. But I don't you still here. I have gotten used to this being here for me. So, you know, it's still you. Yeah. You're going to tell me, like your personality changes when you're in person. It does not.  I'm maybe I'm more silly in person, but I've gotten silly on, you know, in June too. I can do it both now. Just plain silly.  Before we get into talking about your projects, let's talk a little a little bit about that. I would love to know on a personal level what your life has felt like since you left the White House, because I remember and I mean, I was one of the fans, maybe because I also had had journeys. I remember everyone just being like, wow, Michelle, the afro and the hairs come and everyone was just like, she just she's got a different swag about her.  Wasn't there a weight that's lifted from your shoulders when leaving the White House as first lady?  Absolutely. I mean, for for so many reasons. I mean, you know, being the first lady and be the press, it's a it's a huge responsibility. And being the first, you know, we felt a deep responsibility to do it right and to do it better, to be careful with our words, all the things we thought were important things like.  Thinking about what you say before you say it, you know, telling the truth, you know, getting your facts right, all of this, we were worried for no reason we could have done it so differently.  It could have been easier. But no, no, we were doing the traditional thing. And so, you know, it was a big responsibility, a big weight on our shoulders, but it was an honor to serve. And we kept our eye focused on just every day trying to show up. Right. And push the ball forward on the issues that we cared about.  But we were also doing it while raising our kids. All right. So right. You know, they were 10 and seven when we entered. They lived in the White House longer than they lived in any house they've ever lived in.  So they they were growing up right in that spotlight. And so we had that pressure of getting through the adolescent years, in the teen years and sending it to college.  So we were exhausted and stressed because not only are you trying to get it right on the big picture level, but you're trying to get it right as a parent. And now we're on the other end of that on literally on the other end of all of that.  And our kids are about to be twenty three and twenty. Our oldest is graduating from college. They are alive.  So all of that, you know, being at the end of that part of the journey, you know, it you know, I am in a different place.  I feel freer. I feel more at peace. I'm also older. So I'm more comfortable. I'm even more comfortable in my own skin.  I can imagine so. So, yeah, yeah.  It was, you know, I mean, living in the White House is like living in an nice older hotel where you can't get out unless you call 20 people.  It almost feels like you were living a sort of quarantined life before.  All of this is what I tell people. This is why we're fine. Barack and I are like, what? You can't go out just when you want to. Yeah, you're like this. We've been doing that for eight years. You've got security with you at all times. You can't make a move. And you have to think about how your movements impact the rest of the world. Every time we went out, we had to think about it.  It's like who's going to have to shut down what gate? How is this going to disrupt this whole community? Because the presidential motorcade is coming through, we have to worry about agents and not doing something that will put them in harm's way.  We're good in quarantine. We're like, welcome to our world.  Everyone has been somebody who has been not just an icon, but but somebody that people have followed so passionately from the beginning. And and what I loved about reading your book and and talking to your husband is that, you know, is getting into the familial side of things, the personal side of things. I've always wanted to know from your perspective, because a lot of people may not think of it like this because of president, but you're the cool one in the relationship.  Right.  And so like but Barack was like this, like, you know, it's like like you say in your book, who's this? Who's this like, you know what I mean. And yes, he's Mr. President, don't get me wrong. But I mean, to us, Barack, is there a part of you that like when it was done, you were like, all right, finally the power balance can go back to what it was?  Well, he's still pretty cool, you know. Oh, definitely.  But I mean, you know, I mean, it's like a game of chess. You want to lose the queen, you know that.  I'm going to use that at dinner tonight. Right.  But what's fun to see is how it feels like you are each other's biggest fans, the way you show your love towards each other. You've never been afraid to do that. But at the same time, there's also a healthy, competitive spirit. I mean, whether you're selling books, whether you're releasing your your work on Netflix and creating documentaries, is there a little bit of that when you look at your numbers and then you go, I mean, you know, you going like Barry, you doing well, but, you know you know, is there a little bit of that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Barack is super competitive, so, you know, and shoot, let me I am too. So yeah. There's a little there's a little bit of that. I mean but you know, you can do that when you know your partner holds their own. It's it's a nice, funny joke, you know. I mean if he if he wrote his book and nobody bought it, we wouldn't be joking about it. Right. We would be like, honey, you're doing a great job.  Oh, he has a great book. Great book. We love it.  And tell your dad how much you like his book. You know, I mean, he's written like a thousand book.  You know, he's like, yeah, I've done this before.  You're the new you know, he was he fed us on his book books for a very long time. So, you know, it's a funny joke when it's, you know. We're is not true when it's when it's not fully true, the kids are actually joking, they're talking about how, you know, Mom's doing a lot of work out there. Dad, you're at home looking kind of cute.  You know, they're like you're now the one that is hilarious.  You are the cute one, Mr. President.  But anyway, when we come back, more with Mrs. Obama.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Here's more of my conversation with Michelle Obama.  Let's talk a little bit about your new project on Netflix. It is it's a passion of yours that we've known from the very beginning, and that is eating healthy. You know, America has internationally established a reputation as being the country where people have some of the most unhealthy choices in how they eat. I remember when I came to America, I didn't understand it genuinely came to America. I ate the way I ate in South Africa, did not really care.  And then I got here and I remember the first time I came was traveling around the US and nobody knew me. I was doing my thing was around twenty ten and I gained I think it was 18 to 20 pounds in six months and I didn't realize this was happening to me. And then I went back to South Africa and in Africa because there's no like body shaming in that way. Everyone was just like, wow, did you eat half of America?  What happened to you? Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.  You know, and it was it was actually interesting because I didn't think I changed anything. I didn't. But then I came to realize how hard it is for so many Americans to eat healthy, to exist, healthy, to be healthy. And that's always been your passion, which is part of the show that you have on Netflix Waffles and watching the most adorable exploration of eating healthy. Please just talk me through why you thought, you know what? This is the avenue that I'm going to take to further this message for what I'm passionate about.  The co creators, Erica Thorn, Ellen and Jeremy Connor, you came up with this idea because, you know, Jeremy had young kids and struggled with this is a parent getting their kids excited about vegetables. So they came up with the idea and presented it to us and kind of proposed, would you be in it? And I looked at the concept and thought this this is a no brainer. I mean, this is what we had been talking about for eight years through Let's Move is that you can have these conversations not making them punitive or not shaming people, but just beginning to introduce positive concepts about what food is, making it fun, making it enjoyable.  Now, the part that I'm excited about is the work that we're doing through the past the love campaign, where we're hoping to do more education around food insecurity and rising food deserts and reminding people that there are millions of people in this country that are going hungry even as they sit in communities with food all around them.  Right.  But it's it's it's the type of food so many families don't have access to fresh produce. If they want to buy a bundle of kale, they've got to get on a bus or it costs way too much money they don't have the ability to do at home cooking.  The past the love campaign is designed to raise money to help feed a million families in this country.  What I love about waffles and mulches, I mean, we all grew up watching puppets and cartoons, and it's really fun to see these discussions. Like my favorite episode is just the arguments about whether a tomato is a fruit or vegetable. I've had this fight with people my entire life, tomatoes, avocados, whatever it is, I go, Hey man, I have a simple metric. Is it sweet? Then it's a fruit and then people want to fight with me.  And I think it's fun. It's fun to engage with that. I can imagine enjoying that with kids and having these conversations because I grew up funny. I grew up loving vegetables and the reason I grew up loving vegetables is because we didn't always have a lot of food. And I realized very, very young that if I could learn to love the things that nobody else wanted, then I would always have have for all the other kids they were running for, like the meat and the fish.  And I was like, I'll take the broccoli, I'll take the cauliflower. And I just learned to love it. But it's cool to see from that side for the kids.  Yeah, I knew you were on the other side with pasta love.  What I've really enjoyed is you having the conversation about the truth, about how difficult it is. You know, a lot of the time in America, people blame the victim. Yes. They go, you should be eating healthy. You should be making better choices. You should.  And then I remember when I when I first got to America, I was like, wow, how much is an avocado that's like this or how much is this? Because in South Africa, the treat is the MacDonalds. Your family can't just buy you that every day in America. It's like, no, the fast food is affordable and that's no.  Yeah, that's how it was for us growing up. So this is also generational. I mean, the whole notion of going out wasn't something that you did. People couldn't afford it and it wasn't available like that. So going to a fast food place was a treat. But for the most part, being able to afford to live meant you had to cook. That was the cheapest way to. Yes, you bought a whole chicken. You knew how to cut it up.  You knew how to dice up some some some vegetables. You you knew how to cook a pot of green. I mean, that's how we all grew up, and it's with this change in sort of mass producing, you know, the quick, easy and understandably parents struggle with that because everybody's busy now and we're overworked."}]}

The president's unfounded claims of voter fraud and misinformation surrounding the twenty twenty election are proving to be lucrative for Team Trump and his allies.  A source tells CNN the president and his political operation have raised more than one hundred and seventy million dollars since Election Day.  Now, a fraction of this money will likely go to fund whatever is left of the president's legal fight here. But most of this money, there is very few restrictions on any of this, and most of it will likely go to fund the president's own personal activities.  You can take that that piggy bank with him for whatever he wants to do in the future. Oh, I see.  You know, I see you here. We were all thinking that you were really challenging the election results. You were just hustling to do. Even at the very end of his presidency, Donald Trump is grifting his own supporters out of their money.  I guess the one thing he doesn't need to recount is his balls, because clearly this man has a massive pay to go out like this. I mean, damn well knew that he'd probably grift hard on his way out, but hustling one hundred and seventy million dollars from his own supporters who it's one thing to steal all the shampoo bottles from the hotel on Trump.  He's taken the piano from the lobby and the indoor pool with him. All right. When we come back, I'll be talking with Ernest Klein about his sequel to the smash hit Ready Player one. And Rosie Perez is joining us on the show. So stick around.  You already know that the challenge is the most heart pounding competition show on television, but do you ever wonder how challenged competitors are selected or which challenges were too dangerous for TV? Well, you can learn all that and so much more on MTV's Official Challenge podcast hosted by your girl Tourie and me. Ainissa, we're giving you the inside scoop on the brand new season of the challenge. Let's go, baby. Listen to MTV's Official Challenge podcast starting on December 10th on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with best selling author Ernest Klein. We talked about his highly anticipated sequel, Ready to Ernie Klein.  Welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Oh, thank you for having me. I'm a big fan.  I am a major fan of yours, not just because of the work that you've done, but because of the world you created with the work that you've done and because of how I almost want to say, I guess, how much truthtelling you told you, even in telling a future story, it feels like you've told the truth about the present ready plan one was a smash hit, one of the best selling books of all time, and the movie was a smash hit as well.  And now Ready Player two is the long awaited sequel. For those who don't know, it's the story of a not too distant future where everybody basically lives in a virtual world. No one wants to live outdoors, no one wants to do anything anymore. And our true pleasure is gone. And by living inside this virtual reality, which might have seemed far fetched when you wrote it, but it seems like we're edging closer and closer to that.  It does. It was really shocking to me how quickly a lot of the predictions that I made, especially about virtual reality and the adoption of virtual reality technology, how quickly that happened. It's only been nine years since Redeclared one was published and there was not virtual reality headsets available when the book came out. And now there's a bunch of different competing brands, and I use virtual reality all the time.  What I loved about the book is you wrote about what is many, many people's childhood dream, living in a virtual reality, creating an avatar of yourself flying, becoming a dragon, becoming like a an iron giant, whatever it is. But what I loved about it is the fantasy is couched in the reality of, you know, in and around the toll that it has on human beings. We see like real life people not knowing how to interact. We see people just like addicted to like the social media side of this thing and to the world where they can be somebody else you love you clearly love the science fiction you clearly love.  I mean, it's not even fiction anymore, but you love this world. But at the same time, you're always really careful about making it seem like a complete fantasy. Talk me through how you play with that and why you think it's so important to keep reminding the reader of how dangerous this technology could be.  That's a great question. I feel like all of our technology is potentially dangerous. It just depends on how we use it. And and sometimes the perils of that technology don't become apparent right away. Like social media is relatively new, like ten, ten, fifteen years. And only now we're beginning to see the huge sociological ramifications that it can have and also just the way it can affect people personally. And that's true of the Internet in total, I think it is that drastically alter our lives and it's drastically change the way people interact with each other in both good and bad ways.  So I always wanted to show both sides of the technology and also just the addictive nature of something is really enjoyable and really fun, the impulses to do it to excess. And so I always try to show the characters struggling to find balance with their love of technology, which is something that I do in my own life.  One of the biggest reasons I'm a fan of your work is that you did something that I've always missed in the world of science fiction and fantasy for so long. And that is you have diversity like every fantasy story. I just be like, wow, OK, so this is like no people of color in these fantasy worlds. But you have a diverse cast of characters. And what I love is it's not forced you just talking about real people who play video games, whether it's Japanese kids or whether it's a black woman who's struggling with being LGBTQ, why in this world?  And she's going like, what is my identity in the real world? In the fake world, you know? So so my question to you is like, why? How did that come about? Because it seemed so natural. It doesn't seem like you're bowing to anything, but it really informs the story and the characters.  Thank you. Well, that's part of my worldview and part of my own experience of being a gamer and kind of venturing out. It's one of the things I love about the Internet and video games is that by creating an avatar, you create this alternate idealized version of yourself and you have control over how other people see you. The Internet can strip away a lot of prejudices that way by allowing people to connect as pure intellects. And I think I think that's been a really powerful thing in my own life, because you can get to know somebody and feel like you know them really well without ever even being in the same time zone.  So I think the Internet can be a powerful tool in creating empathy. And that was something else I wanted to explore and ready player to the idea of this virtual reality technology allowing you to walk a mile in somebody else's shoes. I think a lot of the problems that we're facing right now can be traced back to a lack of empathy. And if there was a it would be great if technology created a way for you to see how other people feel.  People can't do it on their own, it would be great if there was an invention that allowed you to see the world through other people's eyes or walk a mile in their shoes.  So those are all things I wanted to weave into the story and really play a true and I don't want to spoil it for any of the fans because I would hate to. Someone spoiled it for me. But just the beginning of the story is what if you could be immersed? What if you could feel what was happening in a game? What if you could feel what somebody else was feeling? I mean, like one of the most interesting parts in the story is where people are now experiencing famine, people are experiencing somebody starving, people are experiencing a war torn region and it changes their empathy.  But what you also do and really play it to is you show how hard it is to maintain your empathy and and your level of just wanting to understand when you become part of the class, you know, you've got you've got possible who like this legend who fights the man and wins freedom of the oasis. But then very quickly, he's the billionaire now. He wants to make the money, wants to make the moves. And it's interesting because he's not a villain.  But we come to realize how quickly you can make the wrong moves if your if your environment changes dramatically. And obviously, that means like just being super rich, you think very differently.  Yes. Well, and also, he's a teenager kind of becoming the CEO of a huge company like Facebook or Twitter when you're that age and maybe don't have the wisdom to to handle it. That was something that I knew when I told the story that these characters would all have to confront. And because it's something that the CEOs of all our big tech companies are confronting the implications of their technology right now and the profound ways that it affects even the way people think.  Already, the Internet and social media is plugged directly into our brain in some ways, and and it's affecting everything around us. So I'm glad you picked up on that. That was definitely part of the fun of telling the story.  But when you look at the real world, you look at the Amazons, the Facebook, the Twitters, the Snapchat, tech talks, whatever it is, there is no denying that they've consumed a certain part of our brains. And they're going to inform how we think and even see each other as human beings. When you look at the real world and you look at these CEOs and these companies that they've created, what do you hope that they'll understand about what they've made and what do you hope that they'll apply to these products to try and make them as ethical as possible for the human race?  Well, exactly what you said, an effort, some effort to make the technology ethical and not not just openly allow. This is a mind control device that they created to be used by anyone to sow the seeds of disinformation. It's just something that we've required of like television networks and radio networks for decades. But this new technology kind of rose up without any oversight. And now it's seems to me that it's spiraled out of control and it's still like the wild, wild West.  And now we're struggling to rein it in at a time when it's already feels like it might be too late.  Yeah, you've got to rein it in before it's too late. I could talk to you for hours about this. I mean, because the book will last you for hours and I hope everybody goes and gets it. If you're a fan of video games, if you're a fan of the future, if you're a fan of the present, you're going to love it. Well, I appreciate you, man. Thank you so much. Again, thank you for taking the time.  Oh, thank you for writing an amazing story and for real, thank you for including every single kid who actually plays the video games that they're so often excluded from. So thank you so much for this. Thank you for your time. And I'm excited for everyone to read, really play it to and I'm excited for the next film. Oh, thank you so much.

Earlier today, I spoke with multiple award winning actress Rosie Perez.  We talked about living in the Corona Times and her brand new mini series, The Flight Attendants. Rosie Perez, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Hi. Thank you for having me. How are you doing? I'm doing good, considering everything that's happening in the world better now that you're on the show with me before we get into the show that is blowing up everywhere and people are loving on HBO. Max, the flight attendants, I wanted to talk to you about the journey you've had with Coronavirus, because for many people, coronavirus is this new thing that has disrupted our lives. Your life has also been disrupted, but not many people can say that they had coronavirus in December of twenty nineteen.  Talk me through a little bit of that journey.  Sure. We were in Bangkok and filming the flight attendant and actually was the last of November and I just immediately hit me like a ton of books knew something was wrong. I was feverish. I had a horrible cough, so it felt like someone was stepping on my chest. And I was very lethargic and I was very scared and I was on set. I kept laying down in between takes, actually, Kalicki Instagram, the picture of me laying on bed.  She came and laid on the bed with me. Nothing happened.  But anyway, so they called the doctor on set because I was I became that week and the doctor said that I had to rush to the emergency room. And when I got there, it was like. It was like a movie, I mean, they took my vitals in the waiting room and then all of a sudden all these people came with all the P e and rushed me out and that was getting scared. And the executive producer, Meredith Lavender, had come with me as well as my manager, Karen Anthony, and they're willing me in on a gurney.  And I said, oh, my God. And then talk said, Can I go with her? And she said, Are you kidding? He said, no. And I was like, stupid, you shouldn't forget.  And so then Meredith says, I'm her sister. Now Meredith is blond and Blue-Eyed typical looking white woman.  And the the the doctor looked at me and I go in law and they let her come in, surprisingly so. But she couldn't come in the room that they quarantined me. And the emergency room doctor had told me they put two IBS. One was a red bag of I don't know what. And the other one was your standard I.V. And she was asking me, is it OK? I said, give me everything. And I told I feel like I'm dying.  And she said, Well, we think that you have this new respiratory tract infection that we don't know exactly what it is, but it is coming from. From China and a lot of tourists are getting it, but we don't know exactly what it is, but we do know that it's rapid in the destruction of your body. And I and I just close my eyes and I remember seeing just my husband and my sister and my father was deceased. And I said, oh, my God, don't let me die in Bangkok.  And she laughed, because you're not going to die. I said, You just told me that doomsday is on my own. And yeah, so they fixed me up well enough that I was able to finally leave the emergency room. And I remember her last words to me was never go outside, never stand in front of another person without a mask. You're not only protecting yourself, but you're protecting others. That's why I have my mask on with you, because I don't want you to make me sick.  And what you have is very, very serious. And I said, well, what is what's the name?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about Coronavirus Updates - America's Vaccine Rollout Chaos & International Pandemic News."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And, you know, it makes sense that they're doing this through people's phones. I mean, there's already an app where you can catch diseases, so why not have one that cures them to? What I don't understand is why can't America have that app, too, huh? Israel doesn't even have to change it. I'll learn Hebrew. Everything's closed. I've got nothing else to do. Now, as important as everyone getting vaccinated is, there's one thing that's even more important, making sure that your vaccine actually works.  Chinese company in says it has confidence in its vaccine that is just being picked up by Indonesia, Brazil and Turkey. But there has been skepticism over the veracity of its stated.  Questions are beginning to arise because Indonesia also conducting its own trials, releasing numbers that put its efficacy at about 70 percent. Brazil's findings for this very same vaccination efficacy down to fifty percent.  Yes, much like an airplane touch screen, China's vaccine only works about 50 percent of the time. No Lion King, Lion King, Lion can play Lion King, play Lion King, play Lion King. I guess I'm watching cats. And I've got to say, guys, I really feel bad for these countries. How could they have guessed that China would make a cheap knockoff of the vaccine?  I mean, what is a person supposed to do with a vaccine that's only fifty percent as effective as the others? Stop standing three feet away from other people, go have half a meal in a restaurant, only hug one of your grandmas. Now, just because China is struggling to manufacture vaccines doesn't mean that they've stopped moving forward with technology, especially when it comes to testing for coronavirus.  China has begun carrying out anal swabs for covid in a controversial move that has received some pushback. A hospital in Beijing carried out the swabs when testing staff at a school. While authorities in some hotspot areas may introduce the measure for people arriving from abroad, they've been doing blood serum tests to determine whether or not people have covered antibodies.  And in some places, including a Beijing hospital, they carried out anal swabs, with the idea being that the presence of the virus in excrement is longer to detect. Then if you do, say, a mouth swab, you know what?  There's a point at which I would rather just have the coronavirus, although I can't say I'm surprised to hear this.  I mean, scientifically speaking, the anus is the nostril of the butt. And the plus side is with testing like this, you might not even need a vaccine. You just tell people, hey, we're not having Lockdown's, but. Every time you leave your apartment, some stranger is going to shove a cutup up your butt, we'll be done with coronavirus in like two weeks. And now there's actually some good pandemic news for a change people cases in the US are dropping steeply for the first time ever, and the Biden administration is purchasing two hundred million more vaccine doses and plans to have the entire country vaccinated by the end of summer, which is so exciting, it means I'll be vaccinated just in time for Apple picking up partying.  I mean, partying at like the coolest orchards. I mean clubs. I go to the clubs, you know, I don't I don't pick apples. And while they are still problems distributing the vaccine, some medical providers are getting creative to make sure that not a single dose goes to waste.  A snowstorm that's snarled traffic in Oregon ended up being a blessing in disguise for drivers who ended up being in the right place at the right time. That is because also stranded in that very same storm was a group of health care workers who had been administering vaccines. The workers had six doses with them and were worried the doses would go bad before they made it back. So they started giving out vaccines to others. Among those who were vaccinated was a sheriff's office employee who had been trying to get to the vaccine site when the storm hit.  OK, now that that's a pretty dope story, imagine being caught in a storm and looking into a covered vaccine that is officially the best thing to happen on a road in Oregon. I mean, normally when you get stuck up, they just die of dysentery. Then you've got to restock. Now, some of the drivers, they just chose not to get vaccinated. And honestly, I get that. I mean, if some stranger in a van offered to give me a shot, I would also say, no, I learned that lesson when I was a kid.  Yeah, you can only fool me so many times, Mr. Berry. You know my uncle. But I do think that there's an important lesson here for everyone. Whenever there's a blizzard, get in your car and drive around until you stumble on someone with extra vaccines.

Welcome back to the daily social distancing show March, as you know, is Women's History Month, and to celebrate, we turn to D.C., where she doesn't explore history, but his her. It's no secret that women's onscreen portrayals have evolved throughout history, we've gone from playing secretaries being saved by James Bond all the way to nuclear scientist being saved by James Bond. But I want to focus on one specific aspect of female depictions, the orgasm.  It's when a woman is stimulated to the point of climax, causing a physical and neurological response that scientists refer to as being tested. And over the years, depicting female pleasure on screen is something that's changed more than the batteries in your vibrator. The first known female orgasm on the silver screen was in the nineteen thirty three German film Ecstasy when Hedy Lamarr took the Bratwurst Express all the way to pleasure Berg.  It turns out the world wasn't ready for this.  Everyone denounced it from Hitler to the Pope. And if you ask me, the Pope has no place weighing in on sex scenes.  He's celibate. I mean, when we need your opinion on the best stain removers for white fabrics, then we'll call you.  Unfortunately, being the first actress to climax on screen followed Hedy Lamarr for the rest of her career. She was typecast as the seductress, even though she was literally the smartest person in Hollywood. Yeah, as her side hustle, she was a brilliant scientist who invented the basis for all modern wireless technology. Without her, no one would be orgasming because we wouldn't be able to watch porn on our cell phones in the bathroom. And that was the last big on screen female orgasm for a while because around the same time the Hays Code was enforced in Hollywood.  This was a set of censorship guidelines that banned movies from explicitly showing or discussing sex. Even married couples had to be shown in separate beds or, as it's now called, the reverse chocolate factory before you bedridden for the past twenty years.  It takes a lot of work to keep this family going.  No one was getting off. The Hays Code finally ended in the late sixties, which, as timing goes, is like having your dry January end at an open bar in Cabo America was embarking on a sexual revolution, so female pleasure came back on screen. Unfortunately, it was often treated as a novelty that existed for men's amusement.  So you got scenes like the one in nineteen sixty eight Barbarella where evil Dr. Eyebrow's over here, Trappes, Jane Fonda in a machine that's supposed to give her orgasms until she dies, except that she climaxes so hard she breaks the machine. My goodness.  At the time it was considered a campy, sexy thing. But looking at it now, it's a violation. Remember, everyone, if you're going to put a woman in a machine that orgasms her to death. Nicholson first.  Another major moment came a few years later with the movie Deep Throat.  It tells the story of a woman who keeps giving men oral sex because her pleasure zone is in her throat. That is not how it works.  But Deep Throat became the first porno film to go mainstream and inspired both my uncle's to become Dennis. The female orgasms in Barbarella and Deep Throat were basically male fantasies about how women experience pleasure. So it was appropriate that the next on screen orgasm to make a splash totally debunked those fantasies. In nineteen eighty nine, when Harry Met Sally famously includes an extended scene of Meg Ryan faking an orgasm in the deli to prove to Billy Crystal that maybe he wasn't the cunnilingus king that he thought he was.  Oh.  Oh yes, yes, yes. Oh gosh.  This scene was groundbreaking for a few reasons.  It told all the women watching who had faked orgasms that they weren't alone. It taught men to try to be attentive to their partners needs, and it catapulted pastrami to become the top aphrodisiac of nineteen eighty nine. It also started a conversation about the performative nature of the female orgasm. Women face far too much pressure to satisfy their partners ego instead of themselves. I mean, no one ever has to fake it for their vibrator. If they don't get the job done, they just go back into the drawer and they think about what they did.  In the years that followed, female pleasure became more and more common on screen, but they were still often treated as punch lines like Jennifer Aniston, getting unexpected magic climaxes in personality, or Katherine Heigl accidentally orgasming at dinner when a little boy grabbed her remote control vibrating underwear. OK, there is so much wrong with this. It's nonconsensual.  It's a kid doing it and it perpetuates the dangerous myth that vibrating underwear gives you anything but a five alarm electrical burn. And even when orgasms weren't meant to be funny, it could be hard to take them seriously. Like in 40 days and 40 nights when Josh Hartnett makes his partner orgasm by caressing her with flowers, which, believe me, is not that easy not to be a size queen, but I'm going to have to use at least a sunflower.  The arts weren't a step forward for orgasms, but they weren't a step back either.  They still needed to step a little to the side now the other side, then back and forth. Yeah, right there. Thankfully, in the present day, we're starting to see much more realistic and positive depictions of women popping in Turkey timers these days, you can hardly turn your TV on without seeing a woman getting off. And finally, movies and shows are doing this through the female gaze. And if you don't know what that would look like, then you haven't seen Bridgton.  It's a show about 19th century British society taking care of their little women.  She's a death in the streets, but a Jew in the sheets.  Thanks to Bridgton, there haven't been this many female orgasms since, well, since everyone started watching Bridgton.  So that's the history on the female orgasm on screen. And who knows what the future holds. But it is important because the way women are portrayed on screen holds a mirror up to how they're treated in real life. And as all women now sometimes holding up a mirror to something is the only way they get a good look and figure out how it works. Thank you so much, Desi.

Earlier today, I spoke with comedian and actor Eric Andre. We talked about going from punk celebrities on his Adult Swim talk show to punching regular people in his brand new film, Mantrip.  Eric Andre.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show my man Trevor Noah in the house. Where can I can I tell you something?  You know, Alex Jones might have gotten us confused. Now you're much more handsome than me, so I don't want a left handed insult you. But Alex Jones, when I. I prayed to him one time right at the Republican National Convention, he kept saying, get the Daily Show guy up here, bring the Daily Show. And I was like, which guy?  Why did Sinak Trever. Who is he? I don't know who he thought I was.  Yeah. No, I yeah. Now I could get I would be like, yeah, you know, if we ran around the RNC and then I'd be like, I would even give people that I would go like, yes, I would use you to get away from a crime right now is what I'm saying.  So it's like if something happened I would go, well, what if it was him? And like I would, you know, the dramatic scene in the movie where the people go, you sure it was him? I'm sure. Then you're like, well, there he is. And then you stand up in the courtroom and the is like going to that person. That's what I would do. I could do that right now.  Yeah. I wouldn't blame you. Yes. You've been you've been in lockdown for a while. There's this few people I worry about more than you because I feel like Eric Andre is like the guy of things happening always. You like has this have this thing made you go crazy or are you coping with the lockdown's.  Oh, I've definitely drank way more in the last year than I ever have in my life. I'm talking like Jack Kerouac, Charles Bukowski, level of alcohol. I built a bar in my house.  I'm losing my mind, but I feel great, that's for sure, because of drunk by like two p.m. every day. So, you know, just in the zone.  I'm in the zone, man. I'm just crushing the bike in it and making pina coladas.  I never know how much of this is like you being like, you know, like Eric. Andre is the one person where I feel like you may be in a situation one day when you need someone's help, but they wouldn't know if you being Eric, Andre, Eric, Andre needs help.  I know. It's like where does the shtick end and the man begin? You often got it. But yeah, you know what? I just remember my mom is going to watch this. So, Mom, I'm not I'm not drinking as much as I just told Trevor I was drinking. I'm drinking vate. OK, I do that. My mom is a super fan.  Well, hi. Hi Mom. Hi Mom. My mom is very attracted to you by the way.  My mom and my sister, they would rip your clothes off in a second. You wouldn't know what hit you. Oh wow.  I wouldn't know what hit me to be on. I mean I said that to me before my mom and my sister would do. I wouldn't know what hit me.  Well, give me some reason. The generational jumps adds to the to the confusion for me.  You could get into a very weird porno at the Andre residence if you wanted to. I'm just putting that out there. Offer is on the table.  Put it out there. Let's talk about the movie. Eric, bad trip. This movie, I mean, people have been waiting forever for this movie, you know, it's been pushed back like three times because of the pandemic. I think even Amazon leaked it by mistake on Prime and then had to pull it back. And then it felt like the whole thing was a prank. And then I found out that the movie was a movie. But it's also like a like a hidden camera prank because there's real people in the movie.  But then you've got like a narrative going. It's an actual story, which is very good. By the way, at first I was like, oh, this is just Eric messing around. But it's actually like a good story. And then you're pranking real people. That's harder to make than just a normal movie.  It's incredibly hard because not only are you not only were we pranking the people, but we were getting blocked from the people who were pranking. We're relying on them for exposition to lead us into the next scene. So I'd have to, like, prank somebody and then talk to them for like an hour and a half, just like these two lines of dialogue out of them to get to the next scene. So it was no small feat. But yes, it is a narrative hidden camera prank movie with myself and Tiffany Haddish and Lowry.  Here's something I always want to know.  When you're making these kinds of movies, when you prank the people, they have to agree to be put on screen like they have to sign a release or something after year after year.  But then, like, why do people. Because a lot of the people in the movie don't look the best. Right. Why would they say yes?  They don't always say yes. You will see some Blur's in the movie, but they say, you know what's funny? The people that are the angriest when you bring them are usually the most relieved to find out it's a prank and have the best sense of humor.  Like this guy pulled a knife out on Reland I and then once we revealed that it was just a prank, he was like, oh, man, y'all are hilarious.  Yes, I'm the release. No problem.  So I don't know. It's it's it's it's insane. I don't know. You'd be surprised. You can really.  And getting the releases signed, it's an act of seduction. You really got it. We got it down to a science. Yeah.  OK, so I get like I get on your side, I get like you. This is you, I mean you, you've hosted the TV show where you've stripped naked and destroyed your desk, you've hosted a TV show. There's like fires in the studio. You Eric, Andre, I get how on earth is little rel a part of this thing? Because I know he's like he's like acting and he's he's he's a funny, serious guy. But I don't see him putting himself in danger, though.  He he his very first prank that he filmed was the one where the guy pulled the knife out on us. So we did this prank. Where are our characters? Our penises get stuck in a Chinese finger trap. And we went to this like really good barber shop in Atlanta. And we ask this real barber who was kind of guys, their four sisters. We're like, excuse me, sir, you going to Chinese?"}]}

It's a beautiful film, you know, and people love Disney movies, but it's also like the timing of who the movie's about. You know, right now, the Asian community in America is facing one of its toughest times with hate crimes are just skyrocketing. Many prominent Asians in Hollywood saying, hey, we need to fight against this. Everybody needs to step up. And I've seen people on social media saying, let's work together to do this.  What do you think the significance of a movie like this is for kids and for people who just watch movies and might have a subconscious understanding of what they've seen?  Exactly what you said. You know, when you make a movie like this, you cannot control the environment in which it's going to be released and you absolutely no idea what kind of world you're releasing into. So to be able to be a part of this movie right now, when the news is a comment like because I'm lurking, lurking on the Internet, it's a constant barrage of attack after attack.  And I know for me, like, I just really hope that this is a moment where we can come together as a community and really recognize the pride and the joy that comes with celebrating where we're from. You know, we live in a world telling us we need to be afraid and we need to hide and we have to be ashamed. And to be part of this movie that is so clearly celebrating instead of hiding. Feels like such a proud moment for me.  And I hope that it's one that the community can celebrate.  I am not a young Asian girl. Spoiler alert, I know. But I found that I wasn't alone in connecting with the story in this film. It really is a love story that brings back everything we associate with high school and life and maybe even things we deal with today in society. Do you think the movie did justice to the book?  I think so. I hope so. I feel like the book is all about that kind of warmth and being cozy at home and being with your friends and family and first love. And I think the movie does capture that right.  You chose to be a part of the story and that was one of the conditions. And included in that is you said you wanted Laura Jean's character to be played by an Asian girl because that's who was in the book. Why was that so important to you?  You know, that's part of why it took so long to get made, because people didn't understand why that was important.  And for me, it was like that was what her spirit was, was that she was Asian-American and it didn't have anything to do with the plot, which is why people were confused, because they were like, well, you know, as long as the actor can get the spirit across, then it's you don't care about age or race. And I was like, but her spirit is Asian.  So it's important.  And, you know, it's really about it's not her whole identity, but it's like a part of her identity.  A lot of the time, people think that, you know, inclusion in stories is about just telling the stories of the color of the people in the movie. And so when studio executives said to you, oh, but she doesn't have to be Asian because she's not doing Asian things, you felt like it was about more than that.  I mean, I've never seen a movie, a teen movie, very few romantic comedies, even where the lead was Asian. So to me, I wanted teenage girls to have that experience. I never had to have. Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. I'm a big fan of yours from Silicon Valley and now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now you've got the book and you've got crazy rich Asians, which is coming out to much fanfare.  People are really excited about this. Can you feel the buzz as well?  I've been feeling it for the last three weeks in this press tour and it's crazy. They actually spending money on us, which is which is amazing.  Like like they sent out three teams. Each of us hit like three different cities. And the reactions from each city is amazing. He got the really heavy Asian populated cities like, say, Boston, New York, we expect expected a good turnout from them. But then when we went to like Dallas and people still loved it and I barely saw any Asian people in the audience, it was white people, black people. It's just such a universally fun movie to watch.  Right. That I'm just so grateful to see everybody enjoying. It's really doing well as like what? Ninety four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Everyone is enjoying the cultural significance of the film. It's funny because Ronnie Chang is on the show, is also in the movie. And when he came to me to tell me that they wanted him in the movie, he like really undersold. He's like, Hey man. So I might need to leave the show for a few months to go do this movie.  I think it might be a little bit big for, like, you know, Asian, the Asian community. And he sold it like it was going to be like a little indie movie in the middle of nowhere. And then I saw this.  Come on, I was like, runni, this is major. This is huge. And it really is, because for twenty five years we have not seen a Hollywood movie with a full Asian cast. That's a pretty big deal, says Joy Luck Club.  And I think going in I mean, Ronnie probably wasn't underselling because we didn't know we intellectualized it like we understood. It's important. It's, you know, statistically twenty five years for a studio movie. But we didn't feel how special was until we got to Singapore when you got, like, the most beautiful, talented, funniest Asian people from all over the world. Yeah. You got Asian Americans, Asian, British, Asian Australians from everywhere. You know, grainy Asian Malaysians.  Right.  Like which sounds amazing, but Asian, Malaysian, Asian, Malaysian, Asian, Malaysia, I'm not calling them in the office and I'm going to get a lawsuit via the movie is also great.  That's what I enjoy is, you know, like oftentimes when people talk about diversity, people always make it seem like a charity. But it's a great story.  And you play a character who seems like the most fun ever. Is it true that you you also try to go for the lead, like the really good looking handsome lead?  Thanks for putting it that way. Yes.  When I first got the script, not every day you get a script that's crazy rich Asians with a full Asian cast. So I thought to my manager, I picked up the phone right away. I'm like guys, I know I'm usually the funny guy, you know, like like the character actor. But let me this is an important movie. Let me try out for the leading role. And my manager is like, look, Jimmy, I don't know how to tell you this properly, but they're looking for a good looking guy for this role.  And, you know, here I am. I am so here with you, but you crush it in the movie because you play like a Versace wearing mad party animal.  Oh, it's awesome. It's awesome to play that because you get to go as big as possible. So just fill the screen with any energy you have kind of pent up inside. Yeah, because I think normally as as functional members of society, you can just go crazy. But but with a character like that with billions of dollars and he doesn't care about anything. Right. He lives his life like as if it's lawless. So it is just so fun and freeing to play somebody like that.  You also have a cost that is all Asian, but at the same time really diverse.  And don't get me wrong, I mean, I'm not saying it covers every single aspect of Asian culture, but it is interesting that you said so many people come from so many different walks of life when you're on set. Did you feel that? Because I remember when Black Panther was happening, people were talking about how the set felt different. It was a new experience as a symbol of crazy rich Asians.  There was some kind of magic when we're all just hanging out, eating dinner. I didn't have to explain. Oh, let's go to a Chinese restaurant. It's like authentic, but like not that exotic. You can handle it. You know, we all just so much on the same page.  We all just love the same kind of food. They all say karaoke every night. It was great. You haven't lived until you seen Ronnie Chang sing Backstreet Boys.  It's amazing, man. You are just giving me ammunition nonstop. Let's talk a little bit about the book as well, because I love how your book talks about your journey in America, How to American, an immigrant's guide to disappointing your parents.  It really is a universal story that is all about yourself becoming an American citizen and the journey that you went on. Why why do you think it's really been as difficult as it has been for you to understand the difference or the difficulty in duality, being an American, but then also being Asian and staying true to your roots? I moved here when I was 13 from Hong Kong. 13 is probably a tough age for anyone finding themselves. But I was in a new country with a new language.  I couldn't really speak English very well. And also one of the hardest things, aside from just making friends in school, was dealing with the pressure from my parents, the expectations of growing up Asian. And they value obedience. They value finding a real job.  Right? Well, I'm obviously not doing right. Right. But but in American culture, it's the complete opposite.  We value independence and we value pursuing your dreams. Whereas my dad, ever since I was little, has told me that pursuing your dreams, how you become homeless.  So how do you. Which one do I pick and how do I go about doing this? When I started doing stand up, like my dad thought I was crazy. He doesn't he doesn't know what stand up was. Right. We never watched stand up in Hong Kong. You know, my first stand up like that I watch was big comic view when I came here. Right. And that was like a cultural experience. Yeah. I can only imagine it wasn't just jokes.  It was like about culture. Like one day you're talking about why people do this. Black people did. I didn't know any of those stereotypes. Right.  But that was like broad strokes of America that I learned from TV and watching these comedians, which is in a way culture tellers. Yes. That's why I became really interested in doing standup.  And my dad still till today, calls it a talk show, which I guess I'm doing now. So it's fine. I'm actually doing a talk show. Have a great fourth with a great story. Congratulations on the film. Are you talk about your success, the grind that came behind. But then you talk about, like, just the experiences that you've had with someone you know, many people, in fact, try to reduce you to just, you know, yo, yo, yo effect.  So they went like, oh, you're getting you're successful just because there's like us. Because even now, just because you're pregnant, there are so many. There was a guy who I won't name names that he's not a very successful comedian. So I don't even know if you would know who he was. I don't.  But he came up to you. You wouldn't know you're you're out of there now.  But he came up to me while I was pregnant the second time, and he touched my belly with his, like, fat, sweaty hand, which is so gross to begin with. It's like it's like, why don't you finger me while you're at it. This is so not OK. Like, just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean it's OK for you to touch my belly. And he was like, oh, so this is your shtick. This is like your thing now.  Right?  And I'm like, I was like getting pregnant is not rainbow suspenders.  It's not a stick.  And then he was like, you're so lucky, Ali, because you get all of this attention because you're both a female and a minority. And I was like, yeah, because, you know, historically that's always been the winning combo for recognition and.  And he was like and he was like, you know what I mean? Like me, I'm just another white guy. And I was like, be a better white guy. There's so many successful. There's like there's Jimmy Kimmel, there's Will Ferrell, there's Nick Kaldas, John Mulaney I can name I can go on this whole show for like thirty five days. We'll do like just like comedians.

Ever since Colin Kaepernick began kneeling for the national anthem, professional teams have been grappling with how to handle all the drama around that moment. You've got fans who want to stand. You've got players who want to kneel. People trying to signal the big guy while also keeping the hand over their hearts. But now one NBA team has tried to find a completely different solution.  If you go to a Dallas Mavericks game now, you will not hear or be able to stand for the national anthem because they're not playing it any more. They're not singing it anymore. The Dallas Mavericks have ceased playing the national anthem before home games this season and do not plan to play it moving forward, a decision made by the owner, Mark Cuban. The Mavericks did not publicize the anthems. Remove all this from Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas.  The decision to cancel our national anthem for the Dallas Mavericks is a slap in the face to every American and an embarrassment to Texas. Sell the franchise and some Texas Patriot will buy it. We are the land of the free and home of the brave.  That's right. This is the land of the free. Why aren't we forcing people to sing the national anthem? All right, look, people, I know that this is a big tradition in the US, but just so you know, the rest of the world thinks that it's really strange that America sings the anthem at their domestic sports games. Like in other countries, you only sing the national anthems at international sporting events. You don't do it for every game.  That's like saying grace before tasting every free ice cream sample at the ice cream shop. And can I try the vanilla, please, for what we're about to receive? May the Lord make us come into the chocolate to buy tasty.  I mean, just think about it. What is the national anthem even have to do with the basketball game? George Washington didn't beat the redcoats in a game of three on three. I mean, although he would have do six two in the seventeen hundreds back then he was basically Sheck in a powdered wig.  No we're going fruit going to bowl. We're going to move now.  After the story broke, the NBA forced the Mavericks to start playing the anthem again, which Mark Cuban probably isn't too happy about. So luckily for Mark Cuban, though, I have a solution that Mark Cuban is so going to love.  Now, Mark, you recently ditched the national anthem, and I get it after literally thousands of years. This song comes with a lot of baggage. We need a fresh start. That's why I came up with a new national anthem that I think you'll enjoy. I'll listen.  OK, here goes a little bit of Kansas in my life, a little bit of Florida by my side. Earlier, a bit of you chose one. I need a little bit of George as well. I see a little bit and OK.  And then and then it goes into a call response spot. When I say us, you say a US. US. Anyway, that goes on for like six or seven minutes and then we get to the climax, the big finish now, you know, America is a country tree on the.  Sir, unless you're screwing with us, it makes no sense whatsoever. You are for. Oh, OK, well, while I'm here, I also invented an iPad, but for dogs, I call it the eye paw. I'm out. Thank you for your time. The coronavirus, the only thing with more mutations than Rudy Giuliani, there's good news in America as cases and hospitalizations continue to fall. But with dangerous coronavirus variants spreading around the country, the race is now on to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, which is why in Massachusetts they started doing this starting today.  In Massachusetts, vaccine eligibility begins for friends and family members who accompany a person who is seventy five years of age or older to their vaccine appointment. Only one companion per person is allowed to sign up for this vaccine appointment and a mass vaccination site regardless of their age or health. Hell yeah.  Massachusetts. Oh, this is just like the club, but the exact opposite. The shots are free and if you have your grandma with you, you get in right away. But yes, anyone can get a vaccine in Massachusetts as long as they roll up with someone seventy five or over. And you know what this means, right? It means everyone is going to want to make friends with old people in Massachusetts. Now, in fact, they should just make this the next season of The Bachelorette, who will get Gladys's syringe.  Stay tuned to find out. And this could also make for some awkward situations, because this is when the grandkids find out which one is the favorites or that grandma has been having an affair with the pool boy all along.  I love you all equally, but how the air has abs of steel.  And look, I know there's going to be a run on octogenarians now, but if you ask me, we shouldn't need any more incentives to hang out with old people because old people are the best. They're full of wisdom. They usually have free candy in their pockets and they have lots of practical advice about defeating Nazis, which is super useful these days.  But America isn't the only country taking creative measures to combat coronavirus. They're also making big changes in France, a.k.a. horny Belgium, where office culture may never be the same.  Employees in France will soon be allowed to eat at their desks at work. Currently, the French labor code actually prohibits businesses from allowing employees to eat meals in areas that are dedicated to work. But the Labour minister will be making the changes as part of new covid restrictions as employees return to the office. Now, it could signal a change for a country with a very strong work life balance, with one French woman telling The New York Times the amendment is, quote, a catastrophe.  I agree this is a catastrophe for French culture. First, they start eating up their desks. And what's next? Working up their desks. SLOCUMB Yeah, but this is kind of wild. Apparently, up until now, it had been illegal in France to eat lunch at your desk because they think if it's allowed workers is going to be pressured to do it instead of taking a lunch break. Not to mention it's really hard to get fresh ground pepper out of a keyboard and I'm not going to lie.  I was really surprised to learn about this rule. I mean, I would have thought that if anyone ate while they were working, it would be the French. I mean, the main pastry doubles as a phone. I'll neglect. I need those documents on my desk by the end of the day.  Ha ha ha ha. OK, magnifique. And finally, a story about some people in the Caribbean who were quarantining a little too well this morning, three Cuban nationals are recovering after being stranded on a remote, deserted island for five weeks.  The married couple and another man were found on Anguilla Key, a small island between Key West and the Bahamas.  We actually discovered them waving next to their temporary shelter that they built for themselves.  Pictures show the shelter the three had made with little food and water. They reportedly survived off rats and conch shells.  Good Lord, people, that sounds absolutely traumatic to be on a beach and not be able to Instagram it.  That is a punishment I wish on nobody. But yeah, that's right. A married couple and another man was stranded on an island. Thirty three days. And the person I feel worse for is the other man because not only are you the third wheel, but once that rat supply dries up, you know, you're the first thing on the menu. Why you guys you guys looking at me like that? You guys want to have like a threesome. I mean, something like that.  But for real, actually being stranded on a tropical island seems way less fun than they made it seem on Gilligan's Island. I don't remember ever seeing Marianne walking around covered in red blood.

Welcome back to the daily social distancing show, February, as you know, is Black History Month, and we're celebrating all month long with Roy Wood Junior honoring the unsung heroes of black history. In another episode of CP Time.  Hello and welcome to C.P. Time, the only show that's full of culture. Today, we'll be discussing black journalists, and when you think of black journalists, you think of Lester Holt from NBC or the great Gwen Ifill from PBS or Al Roker's legendary visit to the White House, the first black man to ever shot in the White House.  As I'm walking to the press room to pass a little gas here, only a little some extra came out Al Roker as the Jackie Robinson of going doo in his drawls.  But American history is also filled with legendary black journalists whose work has been overlooked.  Journalists like Marville Cook, who in nineteen twenty eight became the first female journalists at the New York Amsterdam News. Back then, a black woman writing for a newspaper was like an intelligent debate on Facebook just doesn't happen.  But Cook used her blackness to her advantage. Working undercover and reporting on issues that her white male colleagues would not like, abusive working conditions for domestic workers in the Bronx. Cook once even went undercover as a prostitute, and her courage and commitment to the job inspired me to do the same as I also went undercover as a prostitute in my three part YouTube documentary. Nobody wants to hit this. Currently sitting at 13 views and counting. Another notable black journalists was Max Robinson, Max Robinson in nineteen seventy eight, became the first African-American to co-anchor a network news broadcasts.  Robinson's smooth baritone was so compelling that a racist news station once hired him to read the news with the screen black in his face. Imagine having a voice so irresistible that even racists say you ain't touching my daughter's.  But you can penetrate my ears, oh, you won't. Now, despite facing discrimination, Robinson became a success and he did it in style. Legend has it that Robinson once showed up to cover a fire in Los Angeles while wearing a fur coat. That's like wearing a fishnet vest to a funeral. Which is also something I did in my three part YouTube documentary, Nobody Wants to hit this, The New York Times called it pitiful. It's is. And finally, Xernona Clayton, Xernona Clayton was the first black woman to host a TV show in the South, opening the door for future black women, television hosts like Oprah Winfrey, Tamron Hall and Wendy Williams, who I will not say anything bad about because I'm not trying to get dragged by.  Wendy, how you doing? From early on, it was clear that Xernona Clayton was capable of greatness before hosting her show, Xernona would meet with a KKK Grand Dragon every day to debate him, kind of like a real life Twitter beef. But unlike Twitter, Xernona actually convinced the Grand Dragon to change his mind, leave the hate group and denounce them entirely. It was an amazing conversation and a win win for The Clansman. He was able to stop wasting his life on racism.  And now he's got an extra pair of bedsheets with a couple of fun holes. But that's all the time we have today. I'm Roy Wood Jr. and this has been CP time.  Remember, we fought the culture.  You know, speaking of my documentary, maybe it's time to blow some of that extended footage. I've got this clip from when some chaps. I'm up to 15 dudes, I'm going viral. Thank you so much for that, Roy. All right.

He's the co-founder and CEO of Global Citizen, which earlier today launched a recovery plan for the world, a campaign to end covid-19 for all and kick start a global recovery.  We talked about that and so much more. Hugh Evans, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you so much, Trevor. Global Citizen is known as an organization that is always fighting against the worst ills within society. For those who don't know, before we even get into it, what is global citizen? What are you actually doing and what does your organization mean?  It's a global citizen. Is a worldwide movement committed to the eradication of extreme poverty by 20 30. And we're really a membership organization. We've got over 11 million members around the world and they take action and they call on governments to make multibillion dollar pledges to help eradicate extreme poverty within our lifetime. So they might pledge towards global health, a global education. And then we hold those world leaders accountable to make sure they follow through on those pledges. And ultimately, those living in extreme poverty benefit most.  There is a lot of money that global citizens help raise. There are a lot of people's lives that you've helped impact. But 20, 20 has been a year where everything shut down, especially global citizens, huge events that you used to host to get people moving forward. Talk me through what your plans are for twenty, twenty one. Now, if people cannot be outside in big groups, hanging out together, raising awareness and pushing action. Yeah, so so last year, immediately after the pandemic struck, we got a phone call from Dr.  Tedros, the head of the show, and he said he wanted a global citizen to work with him and the show to raise urgent funding to provide personal protective equipment for frontline community health workers. And so we partnered with Lady Gaga and the show and we launched this campaign called One Well Together at home. And it ended up being broadcast all over the world. And it raised one hundred and twenty seven point nine million dollars to provide the frontline workers. Because I'm proud to tell you today that one hundred percent of that money has been fully disbursed and is providing PPY to community health workers all over the world now.  But then in response to that, we know that right now a bigger challenge has emerged. And that's the challenge of of getting a vaccine to everyone on the planet, because immediately after one will together at home, we partnered with the European Commission and we hosted a new campaign called Global Goal Unite for Our Future. And this was really calling on the G7 nations to step up and provide urgent funding to help fund the development of a vaccine. And we were amazed because all all seven of the G7 leaders pledged a total of one point five billion dollars that went to fund both the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccines.  So in light of that, we now know that we have such a huge job ahead of us. So earlier this morning, global citizen Ambassador Hugh Jackman and artist Billy Eilish, together with the head of the Dr. Tedros and the head of the European Union and the head of your own government, that the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, joined us to launch what we've called the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the world. This is five points designed to really put the world back on track to tackle and recover better together.  And so that's really the strategy for the year ahead.  It seems like a monumental task. I mean, global citizen is having a conversation that some people aren't even ready to have because of where developed nations are. And that conversation is what is going to be happening to developing nations, poorer countries who don't have the money for the vaccines, who may not have the infrastructure to roll out the vaccines, because many countries are saying, hey, I know that African countries are going to need the vaccine. I know that all of Asia people don't need the vaccine, but Americans don't even have the vaccine.  So when you are having these conversations, getting leaders to commit portions of the vaccine to poorer countries, how do you balance that out with the people in those countries who are saying, well, we need the vaccines, how can we be committing some of our vaccines to other people?  Well, as I think we've all seen this with the new variants that are emerging of Copan 19, this truly is a global challenge because you could get vaccinated tomorrow. Will your grandma or your mom or your cousin could get vaccinated. But then if a new variant emerges from somewhere in the world that's entirely vaccine resistant, what good is it? Your vaccine will become redundant. So even if you're entirely selfish and don't really care about others, it's in your own self-interest to care because this is a global challenge.  And so that's the case we've been making to world leaders. And amazingly, people are starting to step up. We saw President Macron announced yesterday that he wanted to donate five percent of the vaccine load to support community health workers in the poorest nations. This morning, president of the line endorsed that as well. And we see an otherworldly to start to endorse that because this is a this is a global challenge. And you've got to remember that these vaccines, whether it's the Moderna vaccine, defies the vaccine.  They were funded with public money. So a public good. And so that's why it's not just about us acting as it as a gesture of charity. This truly is an act of equity and an act of justice to make sure that we actually can end the pandemic for everyone, everywhere.  There's no denying some of the parallels here between the covid-19 vaccine and antiretrovirals for HIV AIDS. You know, there was a time when the medical community have had developed all of these antiretrovirals and people were excited because they were like, wow, we can finally fight HIV AIDS. But the poorer countries who were being decimated the most couldn't afford the amount of of that drug that you needed and people couldn't afford to even buy it. So in the conversations you're having with these drug companies, are they stepping up and saying, yes, we will provide cheaper versions or we will provide this at a cheaper cost to developing nations?  So currently, both Johnson and Johnson and Oxford, AstraZeneca are providing nonprofit rates for their vaccines. But other drug companies such as Moderna, they're simply too expensive right now. And if you speak to some of the leading advocates across Africa who are working so hard to make sure that the supply chains reach the continent, they're extremely frustrated right now. They're frustrated by the slow pace. And as you said, it has so many parallels dating back to the 90s when HIV AIDS was ravaging across South Africa and antiretroviral drugs were available in the West.  But it took years and in some cases decade. For them to reach the poorest nations right now, there are literally one hundred and thirty countries who have not received a single vaccine. And so even if we think, OK, great, my summer will open up, I'll have a vaccine and I can get back to life as normal, it's just not the case because a new variant will emerge from somewhere on the planet and that will become ultimately, eventually vaccine resistant.  And you'll have to start the process all over again. And so that's why we have to act as a global community. Even if we're entirely inherently nationalistic, we have to do it for the sake of everyone.  You have thrown what I would argue or some of the greatest, biggest, best concerts. And I guess I mean, it is for charity. It is for good cause. It is to help people out. But those parties are amazing. In South Africa, for instance, you had Jay-Z and Beyonce headlining a show. I mean, Ed Sheeran was performing with Beyonce on stage. You had some of the biggest acts. The question is, what are you preparing for after the pandemic ends?  Do you have like a what's the what's a mega concert to celebrate the fact that the world is going back to normal? Have you have you even thought about what that's going to be and how I'm going to be involved?  Well, firstly, I should say you did an extraordinary job in South Africa. Oh, thank you. You didn't even have to bring that up. Thank you. No, I mean it.  You you were amazing. I mean, yes, it was amazing to have Beyonce and Jay-Z, but the fact that you as a native South African, were able to host them in your own country was absolutely brilliant. And our plan for this year is once we drive home this five point recovery plan for the planet, once we start to see progress on ending her unending covid-19 and not to focus on health, education, the environment and equity, once these other points start to come online this September, it is our dream to unite the whole planet with global citizen live all over the world.  So that's our goal. We know there's a long way to go to achieve that, and that's why we're doubling down this May. It's our plan to bring the whole world just as early as May this year to focus on two issues one, vaccine acceptance to equity. Because as you said earlier, even if you know, this has so many parallels to HIV AIDS.  Yes, sure. Like we did with polio, that we can eradicate this disease super quickly. And it's going to require two billion doses being made available to the poorest nations this year. And to put that into some perspective, because it might seem like a lot if we just right now allocated half of one percent of all the doses the G7 have already secured, that's enough to vaccinate every community health worker across Africa right now. So it's not a lot.  This is something that we can all do. And so, yes, we need pharmaceutical companies to provide that non-profit pricing we talked about earlier. It's one other opportunity I want to share with you this Friday, the G20, a meeting, and they're going to be making a decision about whether to unlock five hundred billion dollars in new financing through an IMF special purpose vehicle. This is one of those rare opportunities like what happened with the financial crisis, where the whole world can act as one and unlock new financing to end covid-19."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about Wall Street Halts GameStop Rally | Regina King & Doug Henwood."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, I think a lot of people, however, are going to hold onto their positions hoping that, well, if it went to three fifty, you can go to a thousand. On Twitter today, somebody said to me, four thousand with eight or ten rocket emojis afterwards, this is the nature of bubbles.  You know, this larger issue here is that the entire stock market is in an epic bubble. I mean, it's really one of the great bubbles of all time. The market's only been valued this highly at a couple of previous times in history for 2000, at the peak of the dotcom bubble and 1929 before the great crash. So, you know where it's really crazy territory and things like. This is a sign that maybe things are just a little frothy, but, you know, I think there is that sense that when people get people who are new to the market get this deeply involved, it's kind of a sign that things are are ripening, shall we say.  There's a saying in Wall Street that a bear market is when money returns to its rightful owners.  And I think, you know, I don't know what's going to set off that bear market. Bubbles always go further than you think they could. There's certainly no rationality to this at all. But at some point, somebody is going to be left holding a very depleted bag.  Before I let you go, does the person who is holding the depleted bag determine how the situation is dealt with? So if the big players on Wall Street, if they're the ones holding the depleted bag, is it going to be dealt with differently from the government versus if, like the people on the ground are holding the depleted bag? Oh, absolutely.  There's nothing right now that we can see that would require any kind of government bailout. A couple of hedge funds may blow up, but nobody cares. There's no systemic risk around that. You know, much the worse for them.  But, you know, I think if some Wall Street people left, left, left, holding the bag, there may be some bail out if you know larger entities than just a few hedge funds to trouble. We'll have a government bailout. That's always what happens. Wall Street's quite an amazing game there. It's always this every 10, 15 years that seem to run into a wall and the government bailed them out. So, you know, they learn that they can get away with anything.  There's a famous story about Sonny Barger, the old Hells Angel who woke up from a coma after a motorcycle accident. And the nurse said to him, well, I hope you learned your lesson. Mr. Barger said, yes, I did. She said, what's that? He said, I can do anything and survive to that. Wall Street cultivates. They can do anything and survive. The only thing that would really change anything is if there is enough popular outrage.  That said, we really need to regulate this casino. Seriously, we didn't really have that serious set of reforms after the 2008 financial crisis. Right. You know. All right.  But not serious. It was not like the reforms that happened after twenty nine to thirty two.  So maybe, maybe, maybe if we see some kind of very serious mash up, we might finally wake up and have some kind of regulation of this business.  And Diane Wood, thank you so much for joining us on the show. I hope to see you again anytime. Thanks.  Don't forget, you can check out Dugs Radio Show behind the news wherever you get your podcasts. All right. When we come back, what would you get? Some advice on democracy from Africa. And Regina King is still joining us on the show.  Don't go away. Lancaster, South Carolina, is in the middle of not much, but growing up nearby. I knew it as the hometown of a black man named Jim Duncan, who became a Super Bowl hero after the of.  Now, my new podcasts return, man. I'll discover that his death still makes no sense at all.  The story was that my brother went to the police station, took a gun off a police officer and shot himself in the head. Most people don't believe that. For the past three years at the Rock Hill Herald, I looked back at a story that's timelier than ever breaking down. So have you got some time to talk?  It involves race, the mental state of the person and a child that was scared to death to say anything. Listen to return man on the I Heart radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast. If you took away the date and time, could you imagine that happening today? Yes, you can. Once you know who it is, D.J., scream Big Bang, checking in big facts has officially touched down on the black affect and I heart radio.  Now, bang, you know, big fix it for a week. Hardiman Today for the sensitive big, big fix, which I put it up about real topics, real situations. And of course, you know, we have no conversations with the biggest names in the culture. Twenty one Savage is on big fast giving up. What's up?  What's been going on with you when you get to a certain level, be like, I got out of college, you've got everything. How can I help my community and I outlive my people? No, I'm saying that you out of my and were staring at me like feel like you complete. I like you did your job and then bigger a big fat nothing is bigger than big facts. Make sure you listen to big facts on our radio app, on Apple podcast or whatever.  You get your podcasts. You know how we come. Welcome back to the daily social distancing show as the past few months have shown, America's government is a lot shakier than it appears. Luckily, though, there's a continent that can offer a lot of advice for unstable democracies. Roy Wood Jr. has more.  OK, so here in America, things have been pretty rough lately. Actually, it's been kind of terrible. OK, it's been a day of nightmares.  We actually had an armed coup. How do you come back from that to find out? I sat down with three political scholars, all from Africa, where they've actually seen this kind of shit before.  Problems of democracy, problems with dealing with election violence could actually happen anywhere. It could happen to everyone. And in the context of Africa, what has happened when violence follow elections, key leaders go into exile.  But Nathan Trunked got kicked off of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. The exile is happening. He can't even get on Etsy. You know how much of an asshole you got to be to be banned from class social exile.  But I think that there should be substantive punishment.  Krafts. That's right, Trump needs real punishment, and I know his supporters are saying, can we just let it go? Trump's gone. He waved and got on the helicopter like Godzilla going back into the sea at the end of the movie.  But it turns out that letting it go is exactly the wrong thing to do.  We may think that January 6th may be kind of this critical juncture where the unfathomable has happened and therefore we will do things differently and that usually doesn't happen. What happens is people will say, OK, it's time to heal and it's time to forget and move on and therefore never holding people accountable and never deconstructing the institution that allows such violations to take place.  That's how you stop racism. You have a terrible moment. And then at a sporting event, you have a moment of silence and then a month later, you act like this should never happen.  That is very dangerous, particularly the black squares on our Instagram.  Unfortunately, these experts say if we're going to avoid a Koopa do well, America is going to need a whole laundry list of constitutional amendments.  You need a universal voter's roll, a elections management body, building systems that are for the people, by the people working with the people to take a look at your security institutions, taking a look at the financing of politics, that's fine.  But we've got to keep the Electoral College write the electoral college exists in order to keep white southerners within the United States by empowering them so much that they would be able to maintain a system of segregation and pseudo slavery, the Electoral College.  I'm going to push back a little bit. The Electoral College was. Actually, the reason that the Electoral College was. It's got college in it, though, so it sounds smart. I'm sorry I'm in you respectfully. One analogy is rebuilding your house. Sometimes you have to gut the house, get the whole house.  Let me just get the property brothers to come in for a weekend. They knocked it out. You lost property, brothers.  You can try to paint the trim and you can change your countertop. But ultimately, there needs to be a moment of reckoning that sounds like this isn't the kind of thing to close on HDTV can fix in out.  It may be the worst fixer upper that we've ever seen.  There must be something we're doing. Right? Right.  The good thing of January six was the Georgia election results, and that is the result of decades of work and political mobilization and constituency building. And so if you replicate the work that created the Georgia result all over the United States, then, you know, there's possibly a good foundation to build from. That's the American dream. And the thing about the dream, though, is that you can't lie down and nap and expect it. You need to work first.  Yes, I get it.  I got to work for the American dream. I see now how annoying it is for someone to tell you that. Wow.  Which brings up one question. After all the bullshit that America has put African nations through, how good does it feel to look at the TV screen and tell America that they need to get their shit together?  It feels amazing. What's that German word?  Schadenfreude that Trump was referring to African countries as shithole countries. Now, tell me, who is that shithole country?  And it's my country you talk about. Well, do you see democracy's hard guys? It's not just hard for us. It's hard for you to say.  Well, America sounds like we've got our work cut out for us. Sorry. I mean, you have your work cut out for you.  I got a backup plan. How much to get one American citizenship passport joint.  Is that what you got out of this conversation? Single. Which one of y'all single? We can organize you an ancestral visa of some kind.  Oh, I'm out. We got to talk. No, I'm just leave America. That's the easiest thing to do. That's what we should have done.  Why don't you just tell me that in the first place, which I'm going to tell him about our local dysfunctions as well. Well, I mean, he's just.  Come on. What, y'all got wet? Nothing. It's very sunny. Welcome.  Thank you so much for that, Roy. All right. When we come back, Regina King is on the show to tell me about the night that Muhammad Ali, Sam Cooke, Jim Brown and Malcolm X all spent together.  You don't want to miss it. Hey, guys, Ben, Ben is here and I'm the creator of a crazy little show called Markinson Concern for Comedy Central Digital. And I'm Christopher Hitchens, plus the voice of Clarkson, whose name is well, son, we made this insane show at the studio that makes robot chicken.  Markinson is a mixed media puppet show that follows an overly manly father named Blac, who desperately tries to connect with his overly nerdy son.  He got some really cool people involved just in Royal and Donald Faison, Jane Lynch, Jim Rash, Deborah Baker, Jr.. It's going to be crazy. So roll your fingers out of bed and peep the season two premiere January 30th on Comedy Central's YouTube channel.  Check it out. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. So earlier today, I spoke with Oscar winning actor Regina King. She just directed her first feature film, One Night in Miami, about the night that Muhammad Ali, Sam Cooke, Jim Brown and Malcolm X spent together. We talked about that and more. Regina King, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  MAN Hi, Trever. Hi, how are you?  I you know, I'm I am I am just trying to begin with the win.  Right. Right. I feel like that's that's the motto of your life. Ever since I've had the pleasure of knowing you from afar as a person and then being able to stand next to you while you're holding golden awards at award shows, you have always seemed like somebody who goes, I'm doing what I can do, you know, defined by the circumstances that I'm limited to. But I'm just going to keep doing what I can do and man, have you been doing it?  Well, thank you.  But yeah, that is kind of my motto. I'm just doing my best.  Doing your best is an understatement. Regina, you have an Oscar, you have a Golden Globe, you have a record full primetime Emmy Awards. You are doing more than everyone's best, in my opinion. And now you're stepping into the world of directing in a major way. Most people direct and we don't know that they're directing. You stepped in and already people are saying, man, this this film could be in the world of Oscars. Before we talk about the buzz, let's talk about the story one night in Miami for legends.  What did you think that you could tell in the story that would just give us, I guess, a reimagining of who all these people are?  Yeah, I think more than anything, for me, while we know that this might actually happen, the conversations are imagined by Kim Powers, who wrote the script, who is an amazing writer, who also co-wrote and directed Soul. So he's he's kind of out there making big things happen. But I think for me, it was that he put conversations that are conversations that black people, black men have been having for so long into the mouths of these larger than life men.  Right. Who we know just throughout interviews definitely have these opinions that are expressed in our film. So I just for me, I was like, wow, to be able to humanize them in a way that they are speaking for so many men. It just it was just grabbed me, just jumped out off the page at me.  Yeah. I mean, you've made a film about people who each have a film about their own lives.  That's how powerful and momentous their existence was on this planet. You know, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, all in one room on one night, having a conversation about their visions for the future and the way they see the world in the way they see life. Now, I know that this was this was also a play. And I know that taking a play and turning it into a film can often be a really daunting task because, you know, a play has everyone there sitting in one place.  And you don't have to do much because that's that's the the forum. That's the platform you have to direct to make one space feel like it's going somewhere. Talk me through some of those challenges and how you how you thought about making a movie that doesn't go anywhere and yet takes us everywhere.  Well, I think the dialogue was star of the film to me and so did all of that heavy lifting. And I just always felt like the right actors, powerful actors who really understood what they were taking on would be half the battle right there. And then from there, just I wanted to get out of the way of of of the story. Like, sure, I wanted it to be a visual experience, but not so much that the camera would distract.  So, yeah, just lots of conversations and preparation ahead of time to just allow the dialogue to be the star and allow everything else to just kind of create all that dialogue and just allow the audience to sit there in it and be be there with these men.  One of the things I've truly appreciated about you throughout your career is that you are an artist. There's no denying, though, that you are also a trailblazer."}]}

The story was that my brother went to the police station, took a gun off a police officer and shot himself in the head. Most people don't believe that. For the past three years at the Rockville Herald, I looked back at a story that's timelier than ever breaking down. So have you got some time to talk?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about Celebrating Asian-American Voices & Stories."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that sort of encapsulates a lot of the foods that I think are truly delicious. But Nina may not be cool or is looks good on a photograph.  Some, like a curry is a perfect example. Bootlicker is so good, but isn't something that's going to be on the cover of a magazine.  And for you growing up, your food was a part of your culture, but it was also something that people used to tease you about. Do you think that that's that's a big part of food is the cultural identity that comes with it?  Absolutely. Because we're at a not a crossroads, but food is more popular than ever before and it sort of intersects so many different parts of culture throughout the world. So in so many ways, you know, creating the show with Morgan Neville and Eric Schmidt, we decided that food could be sort of a Trojan horse to talk about many of the great things in culture and many of the bad things in culture.  Right. Like, for instance, with Chinese food, there's an episode where you delve into Chinese food and it feels like it's less about the Chinese food itself and about how Chinese people in America have had to assimilate and what that means and how the food has had to assimilate in many ways to fit in with American culture. What like what did you learn in that experience when looking at Chinese food on its own in America?  I mean, it goes all the way back to when they came to work on the railroads and how they were marginalized way back then and the eighty nine years or so. And without getting too much of the history, I feel like as delicious as Chinese food is, and it's like the most prevalent kind of food throughout the world, it seems it's never been seen as like as cool as other European cuisines. And quite frankly, I think that there has been a lot of sort of hidden racism in how people perceive not just Chinese food, like basically anything that's different than the mainstream America.  Right. You see that with MSG or how people see like cheap meats in Asian restaurants, Chinese restaurants. And a lot of that's not true. Right. They're just, you know, not even misperceptions. They're just wrong. Right.  It's interesting that you bring up racism with regards to food, because those are stereotypes that you see, you know, rearing their ugly heads all over the world. You know, people go, oh, watermelon, black people and chicken black people.  And they'll be like, oh, you eat this type of food if you're Asian and you eat this, there are certain ideas that come from food. There are certain stories that are told by the food. There's an episode where you talk about fried chicken and what I loved in the story. You know, your roots in the South, you're meeting with people who cook fried chicken, white people who make fried chicken. Do you find that it was interesting to speak to people about where the chicken came from, how it came to be popularized and how they saw the story as it related to the food?  Absolutely. And I think first and foremost about fried chicken. It's a story that, you know, a lot of people don't know about everyone. I think that eats chicken. We'll find it to be a you're going to be delicious again. The world over almost.  But the story of how it was born out of oppression and slavery, for the most part, the fried chicken that we all most commonly associate with. That's a really tough story to tell. Right.  And if we can't talk about fried chicken, how are we supposed to talk about other things that are problematic?  So and going back to the so the the popularity of fried chicken shops, there's a scene where I'm talking to my friends really and questioning them. The same questions I answer myself. And the reality is it's like it's a it's a responsibility that I think today in twenty eighteen that we should know more about and we should talk about. And it's it's not easy to talk about. I mean I think you have to watch the episode because I think we're not trying to answer anything.  We're just trying to start the conversation. Right. Because it's just too dense of a topic.  Do do you feel like that's something people could do, like at restaurants? Like the waiter should have to tell you about the history of the food when they give it to you. So you should be like, what are you going to have? I'll have the fried chicken.  Let me tell you about slavery and oppression. It's chicken over here. It comes from a long history of people being oppressed and like, I'm going to go with the rice. Can I go? Right. No, it's not about that.  I mean, certainly it could be. But we live in a world where there's so much information at your fingertips, like why not go down that rather than just a little bit? And, you know, there's a scene in that fried chicken episode where it's not about fried chicken, where I say to David Simon, great director of The Wire, where I'm like, hey, I would have a problem of someone that's not crazy and starts making kimchi. And he sort of smacks me down being like, you're an idiot, right?  Like America is about cultural appropriation when it's done, like, very well, if that makes any sense. And I thought about that and I was like, and he's absolutely right in the sense that the only way I'm going to get this person that's making kimchi to appreciate kimchi is to let them go down the rabbit hole.  Right. Right. And maybe they're going to be the biggest advocate of it. But if I'm there judging them, saying, like, you can't do this. Then I'm not making any progress there, so I feel the same way about fried chicken, and I think that I could have been that that fried chicken shop down in Nashville because I love fried chicken so much, because the first thing you want to do is pay homage. But it's a problem sometimes, right?  It's a what happens if you start killing the very thing that inspired.  You grew up as a child who was adopted, you were raised by white parents who love you to the ends of the Earth, but in this book, you talk about something that many people struggle with every day, and that is the relationship of being a child who is adopted, who is living in a trans racial household.  Why is that so difficult?  I think it's just difficult. I think, given that a lot of the first of all, a lot of people go into adoption, not necessarily fully prepared to talk about race, which is, of course, crucial in a trans racial adoption rights. Like my parents, for example, went in and they asked a lot of questions of a lot of different experts, social workers and judges and adoption attorneys. And they were basically told, don't worry about it.  You know, it's going to be OK no matter what. You don't really have to talk about this. It's not going to be relevant.  And of course, it very much was right, because you read in the book, you write about how you had this experience where your parents didn't talk to you about race at all. It was just ignored completely. It's never mentioned.  And many people would agree with that. They would say, what? Yes. Why why should your parents talk to you about race, Nicole? Because they don't see you as a color. This eyes Nicole their daughter. So why why do you think it would have been necessary or should be necessary for people to speak to their kids about race if they've adopted them?  It's completely natural in a way, for parents. Of course, it doesn't affect their love for their child. I wasn't like my parents didn't think of me as their Korean child or their adopted child. I was just their child. I think what none of us really knew how to talk about so much, especially when I was young, was the fact that, of course, even if it didn't matter to them, it was going to matter a great deal to me in my life.  It was going to matter. Other people wouldn't notice, they would comment. And I think also none of us were really prepared for all the questions that we got moving about in the world because we kind of stood out in my hometown. Right. Right. So often when I got those questions, I wasn't really sure what to say because in my life at home, it wasn't really acknowledged or spoken about.  Your book takes us through such a painful, exciting, loving, wonderful journey where you begin to explore who you are and you have that yearning to find out the rest of your story. And and that in of itself, I mean, you describe it in such detail is is scary, but at the same time really exciting. Why do you think it was so important for you to want to find who your biological parents were when you had these parents who loved you so much?  I had thought about it for many years. And really for me, what was the final push was when I became pregnant with my first child. Up until that point, I thought, of course, about what it would feel like to have a child and to share my life and my history with them. But I hadn't really thought about how being adopted would affect them, like what questions they might have. And I remember so vividly sitting at my first prenatal appointment getting all these questions about my medical history and what my birth mother's pregnancy and her birth were like.  And I had no answers. I suddenly just felt like this deep sense of fear and inadequacy that this was information I needed to have that my children might need to have. So that was really the final push. You went out, you searched and you found your answers.  I want to give away a lot of the book, but but there is a beautiful connection that you made with a sibling who you discovered or your sister, I believe you have to write and a half sister and a physicist, as you call them in the book. But but you very close to your sister. That is that is a really interesting relationship to have somebody who has been a stranger your whole life and that you feel like you've known them forever.  Yes, she's an amazing person. And a lot of this book really it's her story as well as mine. You kind of get both stories on a parallel parallel tracks and then they intersect when we finally meet and find out about each other. And she's just an amazing person. I feel so lucky to have her in my life. My kids have always just known her because, like, we connected the same month that I gave birth. But it's been interesting to talk with them about it just in terms of like they kind of take it for granted that she's there, that we're together, that we have this family and these relationships we've recovered.  But really, we had to do a lot of work and it took a lot of effort and a lot of heartache to put our family back together in this way. So it's not something I'll ever take for granted.  It's a story about a character who is a man who just dreams of making it big on the big screen and what's what's what's beautiful and what resonates in the book is it talks about the challenges that he faces in so many Asian-Americans and Asians in America have faced with being represented on screen in a way that is not boiled down to stereotypes, right?  Yeah, I mean, it's his dream. So to Willis, his story is basically that he his job is to be generic Asian man on a show called Black and White. And so, you know, everyone's seen law and order. Right. And you have the two leads in the front and they're discussing the case. And way in the back, pretty much out of focus is like an Asian guy unloading a van.  Right. I was like, what if you told the story from that guy's point of view in the law, & order universe. Universe. Right. And I and I started to get interested in this world and exploring the world because the view from the bottom looks different than the view from where the leads are standing. It really is powerful because.  Ute. You talk about in this book One Man's Journey, but but really, a lot of this book deals with how Asians have been pushed to the side in America and a lot of storytelling. You know, some some people have argued, though, that that Asians have a good though because they go like, oh, at least Asian people have the model minority thing to them. So they're seen as less threatening and they're given more opportunities. But but you have a different view on that idea.  Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, the model minority is just sort of the age old strategy of divide, divide and conquer. And holding one group up justifies holding a group apart. And it's not just you're sort of saying Asians have it good. You're kind of showing the other groups you could do it, too, right? Right. And also, the fact is there are plenty of Asians who have not succeeded. There are the characters in this book are struggling economically.  They're struggling to assimilate culturally. And that's a story that we don't see as often we see in the media stories about Asians, Asian-American success, but not always.  This story in this book is is a character who dreams of just getting to play the lead in a kung fu film. That's that's what he's dreaming of doing. Interestingly enough, though, and I mean, I get why the is doing it, that's one of the things that you say, like always broke your heart in the smallest way when you'd be watching TV with your family as you'd look up when you see an Asian person on screen, you be like, wow, that's amazing.  And then they would always be distilled into like a few categories. Like, why do you think that that affected you so much, especially with your children, right?  Yeah, I mean, that is exactly what's happening now, is that I'm a dad and my kids are old enough that we watch stories together. And sort of I had made peace with being, you know, watching Asians on the side. But now they're old enough that I have to turn and explain to them, you know, why is that guy doing a funny accent or why is that person squinting their eyes and playing an Asian on TV? And, you know, there has been a lot of progress.  We see stories about Asians, but we still don't see enough. And we don't I don't I wanted to be able to explain to them. So I had to kind of work through it in this book. And, you know, for instance, I was recently watching the Golden Globes and I watched Aquafina get that award. And my daughter was sitting next to me and it was like I felt uplifted and so did she. I could see in her eyes that this was something that we'd both remember.  And at the same time, we see things on TV where you sort of can't believe that that's still on TV and you're 20, 20.

Yeah, young wizzy babe, I can get enough as I get to get a mortgage at a rate, legally buy a gun in all states. Now you see me on the street on my way to jury duty with a booty. That is good.  Honestly, if you ask me, I think it's incredible that Trump didn't pardon himself because it means that even President Trump looked at Donald Trump's record and decided, man, I can't let this guy off that easy. Then again, some people are actually speculating that Trump secretly wrote himself a pardon that he can use later. And honestly, I hope that he did. Because he's Donald Trump, so, you know, he's just going to end up wasting that part on some bullshit.  Mr. Trump, your car is illegally parked in a handicapped spot. You're getting a ticket. Well, now's the perfect time to use my one and only burden.  I'll see you when I come back from my game of golf. Now, Trump is not the first president to issue shady pardons on his way out the door. I mean, Bill Clinton famously pardoned his brother and a really dodgy businessman whose ex-wife donated to Clinton's library. And yes, don't get me wrong. Trump took it to a whole new level, but he's not unique.  If anything, I think he should have gone further. I'm not going to lie. I'm really pissed off that one of the people Trump chose to pardon, he didn't pardon Joe Exotic because I don't know about you, but I want to know I need a second season of that show. I need more Tiger King. Not the only thing I can watch on Netflix is that Bridget Jones show every day. Bridget, I'm falling in love with that Duke. I'm sitting there wondering what our babies would look like if we were a couple, probably like us.  And it wasn't just last minute pardons last night at literally 1:00 in the morning. Donald Trump also did this.  Breaking overnight, President Donald Trump signing an executive order, releasing current and former members of his administration from the terms of their ethics pledge. That pledge, one of Trump's first executive orders back in twenty seventeen when he pledged to drain the swamp. It required Trump's political appointees to agree to the lobbying ban, as well as pledge not to undertake work that would require them to register as a foreign agent after leaving government.  So after all that time talking about how he's going to drain the swamp, the one rule he actually made to reduce corruption he got rid of right before he left office. But let's be real, though. People electing Trump to reduce corruption is like hiring Hilaria Baldwin to handle your PR crisis. The results are going to be no bueno. But on the other hand, I do get why he's doing this. Trump staffers have to become lobbyists. I mean, where else are they going to go with their resumes?  So why do you think you'd be a good employee for a pet's plus? Well, you guys keep pets in cages and we used to keep kids in cages.  OK, we'll be in touch. I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards.  And it could happen here. And boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history in the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.  The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us.  So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you listen to podcasts, I'm Alec Baldwin.  Listen to my podcast. Here's the thing on I Heart Radio. It's my chance to talk with artists, policy makers and performers like the actress Kristen Bell.  And the moment I said, you know what, I have a thing. And it's a quirky, weird, fun thing that can be snarky and I love doing it. I do it pretty well. Why not lean into it? And that is when I felt like I started becoming happier.  Music legend Mick Fleetwood Fleetwood Mac was always about change so that you were accepted for who you were.  Former governor of Vermont, Howard Dean. I took the call in this quavering voice and the other end of the phone says, I regret to inform you that the governor has died of a heart attack and you're the governor.  That was the end of my medical practice and best selling author Isabel Wilkerson. People have come up to me of all different backgrounds. I would say to me, I had no idea that this happened in our country.

A coronavirus pandemic, because I know America has begun a new era, but Corona doesn't care about who's president. In fact, it's been exactly one year since we first learned that covid-19 had reached the United States and things have only gotten worse. Yesterday, the country set a new record for coronavirus deaths, and the CDC now predicts that half a million deaths will happen by mid-February, which is going to make for a weird Valentine's Day. And Valentine's Day is already pretty weird, I suppose, by an adult woman, a teddy bear as creepy as hell.  The point is, it's more important than ever to step up on covid safety, which is exactly what the NBA's doing.  Well, after witnessing some opposing players disregarding new league rules against unnecessary contact on game nights. The NBA is now moving team security to midcourt following games to stop the hugging and handshakes that may cause an unwanted spread of covid-19. High fives, hugs and handshakes, along with extended postgame conversations are no longer allowed.  This is so harsh, guys. covid won't even let you shake hands with opponents. Now, that's a hard habit to break because we've all been doing that since we were five years old. You play a game when you line up and you high five. The other team saying good game. Next, they're going to say that what, covid won't let you eat orange slices at half time or drive past the ice cream store because your dad says only winners deserve ice cream.  But look, I get it. You've got to do what you've got to do to stop covid, and who knows, this could even create some excitement after the game.  And here it is, Harden going up for a high five. And this is it. Oh, no. He's rejected. He's rejected by a security guard named Stanley at the same time, though.  Well, this really make a difference. I mean, I'm all for covid safety, but these guys have been sweating and breathing on each other for two hours already, and then they shake hands, just like handing out condoms as people are leaving your orgy. Remember to be safe. Remember those fun guys? Remember, they remember there was no I mean, I'm looking like this just shows how covid has turned the whole world upside down. Players are now getting into trouble for being nice to each other, like, yeah, you better hold me back.  I'm about to hug. Yeah, I respect you. So I will hug you right now. Whoo hoo hoo. Anyway, between the pandemic and all the insanity around the presidential election, they have been all sorts of stories that we just haven't had time to talk about. But they've kind of gotten stuck in my brain. And I thought, well, maybe I could unstick them by sharing them with you.  For instance, here's some big news you might have missed out of Russia, a.k.a. Mean Canada, Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic, Alexei Navalny, who was nearly poisoned to death, returning to Russia and immediately detained a dangerous gamble for one of Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics.  And he was arrested minutes after arriving in Moscow, kissing his wife goodbye. Alexei Navalny has now been detained for at least 30 days, prompting outrage around the world. Navalny nearly died last year after being poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon novikoff. He fell ill on an airplane, blaming the Kremlin for the attack, something they deny.  OK, I don't know what's crazy out here, that this dude went back to the same country that try to kill him or that they arrested him when he got there. Apparently in Russia, it's a felony to not die when they poison you. Why did you do that? You make Putin look like you don't know poison. Well, you do that to Putin. Look, even Navalny is the bravest dude alive or he's just really grown to love the taste of poison.  I mean, I don't know, maybe poison is delicious. It's just that no one ever survives to tell us maybe the most delicious thing in the world. We don't know. Actually, I wouldn't want to try poison, though. But either way, this guy has bigger balls than me. I'm not going to lie because I would not be going back to Russia right now if forget get the poisoning. It's the middle of winter or Putin has to do is delay you.  Right, for five minutes and you're done.  Meanwhile, in tech news, here's a story I really can't stop thinking about involving Bitcoin, the money that lives in space over the last few months, the value of the virtual currency has skyrocketed to insane heights, which is great for people who own it. But it'll never catch up to the market value of my Pok\u00e9mon cards. That's right, people.  I've been saving up these bad mom.  What are you doing about Pok\u00e9mon anyway?  One of the big draws of Bitcoin is how secure it is. Unfortunately for one investor, it's turning out to be a little too secure a virtual nightmare for a man with a quarter billion dollars in Bitcoin.  Yes, billion. He's forgotten his password. Stefan Thomas says he's been locked out of his account since twenty twelve. Back then, it wasn't as much of a forger because each of his seven thousand coins was worth about ten bucks in cash. Now, going the going rate, you know how much it is. It's thirty seven grand. What? The man has the password stored on an old hard drive, but he lost the password to that too. And there's only two more tries before he gets locked out.  Wow, what a feel good story in that I feel good that it's not me. This guy can't access a quarter billion dollars because he can't remember his password. Let me tell you something. For a quarter of a billion dollars, I'm hiring people to beat the shit out of me until I do remember. Don't go. Yeah, come on, guys. I know from seven to five. Lower case G. Yes, yes, I remember. And finally from Colombia, an exciting setup for a brand new season of Narcos.  A notorious drug lords exotic pets are now posing an environmental disaster. Pablo Escobar is four hippos escaped after he was killed and are now taking over the marshlands in Colombia. Experts say they are breeding so fast there, there could be more than fifteen hundred in the next couple of years posing a danger to people and wildlife.  They are now saying the so-called cocaine hippos should be shot because, yeah, you go shoot the cocaine hippos who were raised by Pablo Escobar. I'm just going to stay out of the water. And I know some people are going to be like, do you have to shoot those hippos? Why not just round them up and put them in a zoo? No. We're not going to be taking Pablo Escobar as hippos and putting them in a zoo because, you know, three weeks later they're going to escape through a tunnel that they built up from under the cage.  There's going to be a note left behind from the hippo saying no zookeeper alive can hold me.  Yeah, you see, some people would think that the Colombian hippos are going to sound Colombian, but also from Africa. So I like to keep the jokes authentic. I've got to say, though, man over reproduction is the most badass reason to be exterminated. What was the last time you had so much sex that the government had to step in? The good news is there is an easy solution to this problem. Just release some meth. GAYDOS to deal with the cocaine hippo's then to deal with the meth gaiters.  You release the Mully Cobras, then to take out the money cobras, you release the straight edge Tigers. They don't do cocaine because the real thrill is being in control. Here's a question I have, though. I've always wondered this. What's the deal with drug dealers and animals? It's like the higher you go up the ladder, the crazier your pet has to be. The dealer on the corner has a fish tank. The drug lord has hippo's.  I bet that family that invented Oxy has a T rex just chained up in the backyard. Why? You can't you can have gotten more than just fine.  Before we go, as you know, the coronavirus pandemic is as bad as it has ever been.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about Joe Biden's Inauguration | Stacey Abrams."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I also want to make sure that we think about all the other women of color and white women who have entered the space where they are from places of marginalization and disadvantage, because men seem to be men no matter which race they're in. And so women, I think it's just critical for us to not only lift up black women, to lift up women of color, to lift up women when we do right.  But to recognize that we're also always in coalition trying to get this done.  So then the big question is, where do we go from here? What is the job? Everyone has a job for you. I mean, some people want you to run for president. Some people want you to take up the mantle in Georgia. Some people say, Stacey Abrams, you've got to keep going for Georgia. Georgia is the future. So you should be the governor. I know that you've publicly said that you won't be running, but my question to you is, why wouldn't you run for governor of Georgia?  Well, so my first jobs, I need to get people to buy my last book. Our Time is now that tells the story of how we build these things. But my job is to say I am going to continue to focus on Georgia, focus on redistricting, focus on the fact that already Brad Ratzenberger is agitating and advocating for rolling back voting rights. Focus on the work we have to still do to make certain that covid recovery actually recognizes the disproportionate effect that it has had on a state like Georgia, where you have such high populations of communities of color and no public health infrastructure to speak of, I may run for office again.  I haven't decided what I'm going to do politically, but I know that my work is here, my focus is now, and my mission is to help lift the South.  Starting here in Georgia, Donald Trump was a common cause that people were fighting against. Joe Biden is now going to be the president who has to answer and address many of the issues that many Americans are facing. You don't agree with everything that Joe Biden says or does. And I mean, that's that's part of politics. What are some of the issues that you want to see him addressing? What are some of the things that you feel Joe Biden and his administration need to push for immediately?  I think he's made the right first steps by focusing on covid and covid relief. We have to recognize that the disproportionate infection rate, the disproportionate death rate, the disproportionate loss of income has affected communities of color and women in ways that will continue to reverberate through our economy.  They are starting early on that issue, and I think that's the right start. Number two, we've got to restore our democracy. Defeating Donald Trump was simply attacking one of the symptoms. We've got to fix the disease, which is this Republican insistence that the way to win elections is to keep citizens from voting. And that's a solvable problem. And they know we have the bills ready to go. And the number three, climate action, the fact that he has tapped John Kerry to be an emissary on this issue, the fact that he is really populated his cabinet with people like Jennifer Granholm who understand how we can take climate action and turn it into job creation, turn it into a community opportunity, turn it into environmental justice.  Those are the first three things that we focus on. And I think overarching, all of that is making certain that we embed racial justice in every one of these conversations because racial justice cuts across every one of these issues. And if we do it right, we can start to finally reckon with who we are and what we can become after every victory.  There's a moment of celebration after hard work. There's a moment where you reap the rewards. Stacey Abrams going on on a vacation. I know it's hard in a pandemic. There's not many places you can go, but Georgia has, like, beautiful lakes and you've got beautiful areas you can. Are you going to take some time off? I am so excited.  My younger sister Leslie likes to. But bother the dickens out of me because I don't vacation, but I am going on vacation and I am so excited and I need the rest.  What do you do on vacation? What is Stacey Abrams doing vacation? Are you are you that like, sit down, read a book, do nothing type like on a beach type thing, or are you the kayak on like on like a river type person.  Who are you kayaking on. A river is what you do when you're on an active vacation with people who know how to do the balance. But I'm going on vacation by myself and I will be reading. I will occasionally roll over and maybe watch something on TV and then roll back over and start the next book. And I'm going to take really, really long naps. I'm so excited about sleeping.  Well, enjoy the naps, enjoy the reading. And I'm excited to see what the future of Stacey Abrams holds. Thank you so much for joining us again on the show, Trevor.  Thank you for having me again. You're fantastic.  Don't forget Stacy Abrams latest book, Our Time is Now is currently available. So if you want to change your world, go out and get it. All right. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this.  Well, that's our show for tonight, but before we go, the coronavirus pandemic is as bad as it has ever been, but luckily our first responders are still out there on the front lines saving lives.

This is the Daily Social Distancing Show. And today is February 2nd, also known as day two of Black History Month. So let's party people bust out some of that sweet black history music.  We do what we didn't know anyway on tonight's show.  Another reason you might not want to get on a plane. What Reddit learned from watching Wall Street and Biden. Better have my money. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah. Here's a. Before we get started, today is Groundhog Day, which leads me to ask, what the hell is Groundhog Day?  People put a rodents out of the ground and then ask the animal to predict the weather. Really, this is so unfair, because if Africans were doing shit like this and you heard that we pulled animals out of the ground, like there are villages in Africa where people wear animal skin. And if I try to explain to them that Americans use groundhogs to predict the weather, they'd be like, but why not use satellite data? But let's move on from talking animals to e-mailing vegetables.  It sounds too crazy to believe scientists really have taught spinach to send emails.  All right, here's how it works. Just break it down to engineers at MIT report that spinach roots can detect a compound found in explosives like landmines. When the roots detect the compound, molecules in the roots release a signal. That signal is then read by an infrared camera, which sends an email alert to scientists. The purpose of the experiment is to detect explosives, but scientists believe it could be used to warn researchers of pollution. The experiment is part of a wider field of research that involves engineering electronic systems in the plants.  It is also called Plant Nano Bionics.  All right. I'm sorry, guys. This is insane. I mean, who emails anymore? Just DM me spinach. Seriously, spinach, DM me.  But you also know what this means. If spinach just got on e mail, it means that they're not as savvy about it as everyone else. So let me be the first to say Gretchen's my dearest friend, Spinach. I have a million dollars in interest that I suddenly cannot access until the deal much. If you are able to allow me to a thousand dollars, I will pay you back 15 times over. Please, spinach, I need you. And now we play the waiting game.  But Congressman, congratulations to the scientists who are working on this breakthrough. And now that they've told spinach how to send them email, maybe they can move on to the next scientific frontier. Teaching your mom how to use face time.  How do I turn the camera?  Mom, I've got to go. Just ask the spinach. Moving on to the coronavirus pandemic.  It's the reason sweatpants on our business expense. Yesterday, Western Australia went into total lockdown after discovering its first coronavirus case in 10 months. You see, Australia is very different from the United States in the US. Water goes down the drain clockwise and in Australia they care about stopping coronavirus. Now, part of the reason for Australia's success is that Australians don't resist the government as much when they tell them that they should stay at home. And it's partly because these people know that covid is a serious disease.  It's also partly because it lets Australians stay away from all the other things in Australia that could kill them. And it's bad enough that the scorpions and snakes are trying to kill me. But there's a koala that's trying to get me an ashtray. Now, eventually, of course, the world will reemerge from the pandemic.  And I know everyone thinks that they're going to jump right back into their old lives, you know, like going to bars or theatres or using the bottom half of your face to express emotion. But you might want to prepare for a period of adjustment because some things apparently take a little time to relearn.  A new report says some pilots are getting rusty on the job due to the pandemic because, well, there are fewer planes to fly. Some pilots grounded for months by the pandemic have seen the skills and proficiency suffer. For instance, one pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake, damaging a tow truck that was trying to pull that plane from the gate. In another case, the pilot, while forgot to turn on the anti icing mechanism. Other reports include lining up the wrong runway for landing.  To counter such rustiness, the FAA stops pilots from flying a commercial jet unless they have performed at least three takeoffs and three landings, either on a plane or in a simulator in the previous 90 days.  I don't know about you, but this is kind of scary. Apparently, you never forget how to ride a bike, but you forget how to fly a plane after like five days. Oh, man, this is going to change everything. Next time the plane hits turbulence, the pilot's going to jump on the intercom like, are there any hijackers on board?  We need someone who knows how to fly the plane. Harpreet, any hijackers, please make yourself known to the cabin crew.  And listen, I get that pilots are human and everyone makes mistakes at their jobs, but there are certain jobs where there is way less room for error. You know, like as a mail carrier, you might say, oh, whoops, this package was supposed to go to apartment two and accidentally sent it to apartment three. But as a pilot, it's more like a whoopsies. These people were supposed to go to Miami and I accidentally sent them to heaven and trust me now, this is not just going to be pilots, people, everyone is going to be rusty off to covid projectionists are going to be showing movies upside down.  Bouncers are going to be letting in groups of ugly dudes and telling beautiful women they got on the wrong shoes. Bullies are going to give you their lunch money. Meanwhile, until the pandemic is actually over, Americans are going to need more help getting through it. And the big question of what that help will look like is dominating Washington, D.C. right now.  President Biden's pledge of bipartisanship facing its first test tonight. The president inviting 10 Republican senators to the Oval Office to pitch their covid relief counteroffer. Their six hundred billion dollar proposal is a mere fraction of the president's one point nine trillion dollar package. The GOP plan leaves out a minimum wage boost. The president includes and whittles down his fourteen hundred dollar direct payments to Americans to one thousand dollars.  Still, when all was said and done. The White House did not appear to be conceding much ground, saying the president will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.  This is a sign of this effort from President Biden to get bipartisanship here. But it also comes as Democrats on Capitol Hill are paving the way to move forward with only Democratic votes for this relief package.  Look, man, I'm not going to lie. I get why Democrats and Republicans are having trouble agreeing on this relief package. I mean, this is a difference of one point three trillion dollars. How do you compromise when you're that far apart? It's like deciding what you want to get for dinner and you want something nice, but your date wants to eat out of a gas station, trash can. You can't compromise and eat out of a nice trash can.  But I also do love how Republicans suddenly get stingy the second that a Democrat comes into office, because don't forget, during the Trump years, they were handing out tax cuts with a strip of money gun. But now that Biden is president, suddenly they're trying to hand out covid relief a penny at a time, one penny to OpenEdge. Am I making it rain yet? Three pennies? Yes. More of a drizzle. I agree. Now, a lot of people are upset about the Democrats plan to give people fourteen hundred dollars because they say that the Democrats promised to give people two thousand dollars.  But the Democrats are arguing that everybody already got the first six hundred a month ago. And I get the Democrats point on this one. But at the same time, so many people are struggling right now. Why not just give them twenty six hundred instead? I mean, you can find the money somewhere. Just take it from spaceports. Trump is gone. We don't have to pretend that that's a thing anymore. And finally, let's move on to the second.  Most talked about Instagram video from last night's Ofter Courtside Karen The Post by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who gave a harrowing account of her personal experience during the capital attack.  We're getting an eye opening new look inside last month's siege on the US Capitol. Ocasio Cortez describing the impact of the riots, sharing details about what happened to her during the insurrection at the Capitol, telling her viewers she felt like she was going to die.  All of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on my door like this, like I'm here. And the bathroom door starts going like this, like the bathroom door is behind me or rather in front of me. And I'm like this. And the door hinges right here.  And I just hear, where is she? Where is she?  And this was the moment where. I thought everything was over, you know, I just happened to. You know, be a spiritual person and be raised in that context, and I really just felt like, you know. If this is the plan for me. Then people will be able to take it from here. Wow. You know, for a lot of us at home, the capital riots were basically an action movie on TV. I mean, it was scary, intense and terrifying, but at the end of the day, we were just watching it.  But an action movie is very different when you are actually in the movie. I mean, AOC and other members of Congress literally thought that they were going to die on a Wednesday afternoon, no less. I mean, nobody should die in the middle of the week. That means you went to work on Monday and Tuesday for nothing. And thank God that no members of Congress were actually hurt. But even just believing that you're going to die is a major trauma.  And ABC handled it way better than I would have. I mean, she was like, if this is where my journey ends, so be it. If I thought about it, I wouldn't be pondering my journey. I'd be trying to delete my browser history. And to everyone out there who's saying, oh, how scared could she really have been? How scared could she have been? Think about how terrified you get when someone knocks on the bathroom door when there isn't even a riot.  So once you hear, oh, God, no, they're going to know that I poop. So I'm glad that ABC shed the story because many Republicans in Congress would like to just pretend that this shit never happened, that the lives of Congress members and their staff weren't in danger, and that police officers guarding the Capitol weren't injured and killed. But if there's no accountability, then it becomes easier and easier for it to happen again. And the last thing we need from this action movie is a sequel.  Right. When we come back, we'll look at why hedge funds are so mad about the GameStop uprising. And Ibrahim Scandi is joining us on the show.  So don't go away. I've got one word for you, Tom Cruise, on this new weekly podcast meeting, Tom Cruise, we're going to talk about Tom Cruise. We're going to talk to people who have met Tom Cruise. Why? Because Tom Cruise is the greatest movie star of all time. Is he, though? Shut your mouth. Everyone who has met him has an amazing story to tell. And that's where he met Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise.  When I hear the bathroom door open and it's Tom Cruise. Hey, everybody, I'm Jeff Meacham. You might know me as Josh Open Hole from TV's Blackfish. And I'm here with the ghost of my maverick. Hey, I'm Joel Johnston. You might know me as Archie and the marvelous Mrs.. And I'm Alec Lev. And you know, no one knows you from anything. Listen, we love Tom Cruise. We are inspired by Tom Cruise. But while we live and work in Hollywood, we've never actually met Tom Cruise.  So we're going to talk to some people who have and maybe one of them will lead us to the man himself so we can have our own. Of meeting Tom Cruise does really have to, Jessica, about Tom Cruise. What are you here? Listen to meeting Tom Cruise on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.  Hi, this is Bill Clinton.  Please join me on my podcast. Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this for conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know. We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future. Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  Welcome back to the daily social distancing show. By now, you've probably heard about the GameStop uprising, the biggest thing to happen with video games since Sonic got busted for doping. But if you haven't heard the news, what happened was that some Wall Street hedge funds bets a lot of money that the stock price of the video game store GameStop would fall. But a bunch of people on Reddit found out about those bets. So they started buying GameStop shares so that the price would go up and the hedge funds would lose a lot of money and lose a lot of money they did in the billions of dollars.  So as you can imagine, Wall Street is pretty unhappy with those Reddit investors.  A handful of industry leaders are calling for an investigation because of the angry mob that's formed against them.  Last week was a free market. It was a free for all market, no doubt about it.  For my twenty five years in the business, I've never seen this form of collusion on such a widespread fashion. This type of behavior is not the behavior that you want to be replicating. I think there is something obviously wrong, and it's the gamification of Wall Street.  Talk to an analyst this morning, guys. He said this is dangerous. They forget they're buying a stock in a piece of a company. It's not just some symbol that you play hot potato with it.  Just because you throw the Hail Mary pass in your back yard and it's caught for the touchdown in the wind. Doesn't mean you're Tom Brady.  What's going through my mind is how irrelevant I feel and how every day I just don't want to get out of bed and how it's the least amount of fun I think I've ever had. Oh, man.  These Wall Street guys are taking this so hard that the interviews are just turning into therapy sessions.  I feel so irrelevant right now and I'm not having any fun. And I just remembered my parents never hung my paintings on the refrigerator.  But the truth is, what the Rediscuss did here is nothing new. In fact, the only thing that makes this so unique is that this is just the first time that the little guy has used the big guys tactics against him, because when it comes to manipulating the market and treating trades like a game, no one is better at it than Wall Street. I mean, they do this shit all the time."}]}

Fox."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this is your fourth one now. But in the book, what I really found endearing and it makes you want to laugh and at times what makes you want to cry is you share how hard it is to stay optimistic. You know, you share moments where you go like actually, I don't know if I'm optimistic every day.  Actually, I am depressed, actually. It's like Parkinson's sucks. Actually, life isn't always easy. Talk me through why you decided to write a book that had like a different tone to what we've heard from you so much in the past.  I had such a cranky look at me, but I'm a little cranky but cranky man I was joking to kind of. But what happened was I with Parkinson's, I've reached kind of detente where that I just like it is the case. It the Roomba takes up. I do other stuff and then I just deal with it that way. And that is an optimistic point of view. It's just going to say glass half full. I mean, it sounds cool and and can you do it that way?  Then they get this thing, which is a tumor on my spine, which they defend. They said this is going to paralyze you, Schreuder. We get to get up. I guess you want to take it out of this doctor in Baltimore, Johns Hopkins. I don't consider who's great who said, I'll take it up. I can tell you why it you want to pay it out because you must be the guy who paralyzes Michael J. Fox.  I said that's where the balls to say that to me. I you the guy, he's a nice and easy Deschutes and that was fine. I will we learn to walk again. I mean literally learning the mechanics and the walking in and all that stuff and finally got to where I'm sure to get to finally get to where was alone. That's the first time in months I had no AIDS, no hanging on me. And I was walking in the hallway in my apartment feeling like a big shot, walking into the kitchen, sit on a tile floor in the shadow of my tumors and and mutilate it.  And and I was laying on the floor with my alarm. And he put a pretty shiny face on this. Make this happy.  This is this is just sex is only sex, sex and more than that, that it sucks because this is not good. And they begin a whole conversation. It should have been about. But had it been had I like.  Put up optimism, panacea, had I said today, we agreed we had a commodify hope, right. And I had make this a thing and it's not a thing. It's something you feel you arrive at. It's an optimism. It's an action. It's not a worry. It's not a bad idea. I started to look at what what brought me optimism. The first one was about optimism. That was what is my default mode? Get the standard for me.  And I did things I found myself thinking about, which all of you fear and just opportunity. And and when I came to his acceptance. Gratitude. If you if you if you granted in everything some peace of gratitude that some element of something and activism survives.  Wow, because it's easier for you to get to.  Before I let you go, I wanted to talk to you about the work that you have done that I think few human beings would even dream of being able to do in any field. And that is I think you've put over a billion dollars into Parkinson's research. You've helped raise this money.  Do you do you know how close we are to seeing a cure? And do you think that we'll see a cure within your lifetime? What are some of the leaps that you've seen in the work that you've done that have given you hope?  I don't know that it'll make a big difference in my life because I am basically 20 miles in a car already. I mean, I'm one of those babies that we get from the new engine. It is hard. And we do realize that if you told me 20 years is a billion dollars and not have the cure yet, when I started, I said, I hope we say this, but because we've done in 20 years, it really is really important work and excessive access to data.  Whether it's so we have to think of the biomarker initiative. We're also finding new ways to to to get in the brain to to to get visuals to to get to be able to see where how a protein that and damages to the brain tissue. So that image. And so so we work on all these big problems in one day that is going to be like this is the right combination of glue and honeycombs going to make it all happen.  I like that. That's the best description for science. One day the glue in the pinecones, we'll meet and we'll have the cure for what we need. Thank you for taking the time. Thank you for making me your first Daily Show host. And thank you for being my first Michael J. Fox. I appreciate you send my love to the family and we'll we'll have you back for the fifth memoir. Don't break any more arms. Look after yourself.  Yeah. All right, thank you so much. Appreciate it. No time like the future is available now. And you can go to Michael J. Fox dot org to learn about his work to eliminate Parkinson's disease. That's our show for tonight.  But before we go, as you may have heard, there is an important runoff election coming up in Georgia. And if you're watching this from the Peach State, the deadline to register to vote online for that election is next Monday, December 7th. Now, if you're not in Georgia, you can still help out by supporting groups like 18 by votes that are trying to work to engage young people to vote, especially the estimated twenty three thousand young people in Georgia who were not eligible to vote in the general election but are eligible to vote now in January 5th.  So if you are able to help out and you want to support the cause, then please check out the link below until tomorrow.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the beginning of a Trevor Noah podcast about ICYMI - Jonah Goldberg on Suicide of the West and Preserving the American Experiment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're listening to Comedy Central.  Now, it was up in question this week on Queensland's Supreme, we're getting cozy with the legend Mariah Carey, an intimate two part episode.  Nobody knew who I was and they introduced me. Ladies and gentlemen, Columbia recording artist writer Charlie Black and White. Then at the end of it.  Announcer He's like Nobelists.  Now, as we listen to Koslov Supreme on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast so much.  My guest tonight is a senior editor at National Review and L.A. Times columnist, American Enterprise Institute scholar and bestselling author whose latest book is called Suicide of the West How the Rebirth of Tribalism, Populism, Nationalism and Identity Politics is Destroying American Democracy. Please welcome Jonah Goldberg.  I thought about calling you up sort of a McCrone versus Trump kind of thing and getting all antsy, but I decided we should have done that.  We should have done a little handshake into a kiss into like a little moment into a thing. Yeah. And I could have, like, whispered, I like your musk, which is way I think he was saying to him at one point felt like it felt like a Trump crush really into him, which is something that is good for America.  Yes. Yeah.  Maybe, you know, if it's good for America, for us to get along with, you know, our two hundred year old allies.  That's right.  But if he's only doing it because is sucking up to him less good, right?  I mean, it should be they're getting along because we have mutual interests, we have mutual values and they reflect that. It shouldn't be because the leader of France says not only are you a handsome man, you're a powerful man. Right? I mean, it shouldn't just be sucking up. It should be something more.  I feel like it should just be that. Yeah. Welcome to the show. Great to be here. Thanks. Thank you for coming through.  And you have written quite a book here, Suicide of the West, if ever there there's a title that would catch you. Is that why the title of the book?  Well, in part because I didn't say the death of the West or the decline of the West, as grim as the title sounds and it actually doesn't end.  As grim as it sounds, suicide's a choice choose to do to make these decisions that you're making.  And I think that one of the things that people don't appreciate is that if you you can you can choose not to do them as well.  And then a lot of the things that are are plaguing this country are within our own power to fix. Right.  It's interesting because you talk about nationalism, tribalism, populism, all of these things that you believe are leading to the decline of America.  When you talk about the decline of America, are you specifically referring to capitalism and the way it's made America thrive over the past three hundred years?  In part, I mean, I call this thing the miracle, right? And the miracle isn't just capitalism. It's also natural rights, civil rights, free speech, all of the things that we associate with the Bill of Rights, the idea that the individual sovereign, that we are captains of ourselves, that we are citizens, not subjects, that the government works for us.  We don't work for a government.  These are all unbelievably new ideas in the history of humanity. Humanity split off from the Neanderthals like three hundred thousand years ago. And for most of humanity's existence, we were poor, ignorant, bloody, violent creatures. Right. And and our human nature hasn't changed.  We are still the same creatures we were ten thousand years ago. What has changed are our values, our norms, our institutions. And if you don't have gratitude for them and if you don't try to protect them, they'll go away.  And it's interesting that you say that you go if we if we don't have gratitude for them, if we don't try to protect them, because that seems like an argument many people in America will use for one group or another.  What's interesting in this book is you refer to both sides of the political spectrum doing similar damage to an idea that that may cause damage to that idea in the same way. So, for instance, you write for National Review as a conservative writer, but at the same time, you are not a fan of Trump.  I think that's fair. Right.  So you are saying that populism, both on Trump's side and on the left, there's a danger of that hurting Americans?  That's right.  There's nothing wrong with a little populism, right? There's nothing wrong with a little nationalism. It's like a pinch of salt brings out the flavor in the meal, right. Too much ruins the meal and way too much is literally poisonous. Right. And so all poisons are determined by the dosage. My favorite New Yorker cartoon, which my wife got blown up for me a few years ago and framed, has two dogs drinking martinis at a bar.  And one dog says to the other, you know, it's not good enough that dogs succeed. Cats must also fail.  Right. And that's sort of where we are as a culture right now where it's not.  And this drives me crazy about my own side these days, where I talk to young conservative activists, college students, and I say, look, by all means, fight political correctness, if that's what you want to do. Right.  But just because being rude is politically incorrect doesn't mean being rude is good. And so much of what's happening, I think on both sides of the political aisle is this this idea that you can do almost any horrible thing if it annoys the right people. Right.  And that's a huge part of the defense of Donald Trump, which I just find intellectually bankrupt, which is, well, he's got the right enemies or he's making the right people upset. What you have to look at what what is actually upsetting them. Right.  And some of the things that upset liberals and lefties I can agree with and I'll support. But some of the other things are just sort of crassness rudeness for its own sake. And I don't see why I should defend that just because he's on my team, as it were.  It's interesting that you bring up teams because it does feel like America's. Drifting into a space where politics is solely about teams, you pick your team or whatever your team does, you defend. So the other team, whatever they do, you pick the opposite.  The ref is biased. This is against us. Those are not facts because they don't work in our favor. Does this, in your opinion, lead to a place where the experiments of America begins to decline? Is is that the only thing that's kept it moving or has it just been an illusion that's lasted for three hundred years because there were people who were previously oppressed and that wasn't something that America ever was? No, look.  I mean, look, are there bad things in American history that we need to atone for them to fix or that we have problems today that we need to still work on? Absolutely. My point is, is that, again, human nature has no history. Human nature is a constant.  We have if you took a kid from New Rochelle and you sent them back to a Viking village to be raised by Vikings a thousand years ago, he would end up going pillaging the English countryside. Right. You take a Viking baby and you bring it to New Rochelle.  He's going to grow up to be an orthodontist. Right.  And a very big orphan. Yeah. And so these challenges exist in every generation. It is human nature to want to be part of your tribe.  We are hardwired to be part of a group. That's how we evolve, is to say I will do everything to help in Darwin writes about this. I will do everything to help my team, my friends, my kin, my family, my allies, my coalition.  And the stranger is the enemy. Right.  And what you know, and so people you know, there's a common cliche that says people have to be taught to hate.  No, they actually have to be taught not to hate.  That's what civilizations do is teach people to see.  And it starts with Christianity or Judaism. You go way back in the religion department. But the fundamental insight is that you need to teach people that strangers have human dignity, that strangers are decent people. And just because you don't know them doesn't mean or don't agree with them. It doesn't make them the enemy. And I think we're falling down on that in our politics and our education.  And instead we're telling people, just go with your feelings. Your rage is more important than facts or argument. Right. And that's where you get populism. That's where you get a lot of nationalism, too.  But if you if you have somebody who is trying to end you, how do you then work on responding to that?  Because that's something that I that I'm always trying to figure out in my head is it's one thing for people to say, let's keep politics civil. Let's not have an argument, let's not point each other out as enemies, etc. But there are times when let's say Charlottesville is a good example.  Sure, there are people who are literally saying we are Nazis.  These people are wishing for the end of other human beings. It's a bit difficult at that point to say yes, yes, but let us let us sit with them and engage as they drive over us.  It's a very difficult space to be in.  I agree with you and look like my last name's Goldberg. I'm not really a turn the other cheek guy.  I'm more of a smiting and wrath guy, so I get what you're talking about. But right. But my point is, and I agree with you and tell you about the neo-Nazis.  One of the things that infuriates me about what Steve Bannon and some of the people around Trump did was claim that somehow a bunch of friggin Nazis were part of our coalition. And I would keep trying to explain to these people, no, you and they literally say that they want to get rid of people like me, people like you.  Why? Why should I for a common group with them just to get this guy elected or just for political purposes, whatever?  Some things are existential questions. And I'm not saying that we should have gone into Charlottesville and shot a bunch of Nazis. Right.  But the idea that somehow they have something important to say, though, I need to find common ground with them, I I think is ridiculous. Right.  I also think it's ridiculous to call people who aren't Nazis, Nazis as a way to demonize them.  And I think there's a lot of that that's going on, too. And so it's a prudential question and you have to sort of figure it out as you go. It doesn't mean you can't have big arguments. I've always believed that democracy is about disagreement, not about agreement. It's about having arguments. What I don't like about our politics right now is how people don't think arguments matter at all, that facts don't matter, that, you know, the whole point of the Enlightenment was this idea that you could persuade people.  Right.  And part of the reason I wrote this book is it's much a cautionary tale to my allies. On the right is that a lot of people are just giving up on persuasion and instead it's just hammer and tongs. Cats must fail.  It's all about power.  The arguments in defense of Donald Trump in the in twenty sixteen, we're all about winning and strength, winning and strength or not. They're absolutely a concepts. Winning for what? Strength. For what. Unity. For what it has to be the ideas that underlie it.  And we're in a moment where a lot of people just don't care about ideas anymore.  One of the big ideas that you share in the book is that America needs to focus on less identity politics on both sides and more on merits, because merit's is how capitalism thrives is what moves the society forward.  When you say that, though, do you think sometimes a statement like that ignores the fact that some people's merit is overlooked because of identity politics?  Yeah, look, look, you know, it's funny. Like most of the liberals I talked to, they like the words. They agree with me on the populism and nationalism. And they don't like the and the tribalism. They don't like the identity politics. Right. Right.  I am not saying that you can't all I'm not saying that there isn't discrimination out there. Obviously there is. What I'm saying is that one of the great and glorious things and Barack Obama was very eloquent about this, about this country is is not that America were the founding fathers were hypocrites when they started this country.  They were you know, slavery was a big you know, the big you know, what about that? Right. Right. Great description. What about that?  But you know what I'm getting at, right.  So what happens is then Abraham Lincoln comes along with the Gettysburg Address and he redefines what this country is about, about equality.  And then Martin Luther King says, hey, wait a second. One hundred years later says, wait a second. The Founding Fathers wrote a promissory note to the American people that all men, including black men, are created equal.  It's the unfolding of that story, right? That that is what matters.  And so one of the core values, all of civilization is, is the story we tell ourselves about ourselves.  And one of the reasons why Martin Luther King was so persuasive is he was appealing to the best ideals of white America and saying you should take people as you find them. One of the great things about the American founding, which doesn't get taught anymore, is that we got rid of titles of nobility.  We got rid of of the notion that simply by an accident of birth, one person is better than another person.  And so a little identity politics, just like a little nationalism in terms of ethnic pride and solidary.  All of that is fine when you start reducing whole categories of people to an abstraction and say, all I need to know about you is the color of your skin.  Right. That's when you get into a problem.  And this idea that all white people are racist is is, first of all, not true. You know, intermarriage rates between white and blacks are going through the roof. They can't all be racists. Right.  But but I think the argument is less all white people are racist and the system has been created by white people to oppress people of color. So I think when when people say why people are racist, I think that's disingenuous. But most of the time, the argument people are saying is, hey, we can admit that the system from the founding fathers through to redlining, through segregation was written in such a way that it would benefit one race over another.  It would it would hamper the cats and allow the dogs to succeed.  And look and I think there's obviously a lot of truth to that. At the same time, the definition of what counts as white changed over time. You the Benjamin Franklin changed for everyone except black people. But it's true that and that's true, too.  And that's my that's part of my point, is that it is an outrage that this country took so long to include everybody in this idea of universal equality.  That is not an argument for getting rid of the value of universal equality. Right. Right. It is.  It is to say that we need to be more consistent in applying these ideals rather than saying these ideals themselves are bankrupt, because it is these ideals that for all of human history, the average human being everywhere on Earth lived on average of three dollars a day, Africa, Asia, Europe, everywhere.  And then once and only once in all of human history, it starts to go like this. And it's because these ideas start getting put into action. I think we should be.  We live in this moment of the greatest alleviation of material poverty in all of human history. Hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa coming out of poverty."}]}

Are you hopeful about where America has gotten to now on this day, or are you trepidations in considering where America still needs to get you?  I'm hopeful, but as I describe it, I have the optimism of a box of going into the late rounds.  And what I mean by that is if you haven't been knocked out yet, if you're still upright, the thing that kept you throwing punches and staying in the fight for this long is the thing that will bring you all the way to the finish line. And so is James Baldwin said I have to be an optimist because I'm alive. That said, I don't think you should underestimate the scale of the problems that we're confronting. But dynamics that produced Trump are still very active in the society.  The anxiety around immigration, the anxiety around race, the ways in which those compound the economy that truthfully does not serve many people struggling just to get by from day to day. And the way that that has been weaponized and used to fuel xenophobia and racism and so on. Those are very real dynamics and very real problems. And they will not be easily defeated. But I don't think that they are permanent. And I don't think we have to always presume that we can't somehow close off so well.  It's going to be an exciting 12th round. Hopefully we get to chatting again afterwards and we haven't been knocked out. Jelani Cobb, thank you so much for joining me on the show.  Thank you. All right. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this. I'm Alec Baldwin. Listen to my podcast, here's the thing I heart radio, it's my chance to talk with artists, policy makers and performers like the actress Kristen Bell.  And the moment I said, you know what, I have a thing. And it's a quirky, weird, fun thing that can be snarky and I love doing it. I do it pretty well. Why not lean into it? And that is when I felt like I started becoming happier.  Music legend Mick Fleetwood Fleetwood Mac was always about change so that you were accepted for who you were.  Former governor of Vermont Howard Dean. I took the call in his quavering voice, and the other end of the phone says, I regret to inform you that the governor has died of a heart attack and you're the governor.  That was the end of my medical practice and best selling author Isabel Wilkerson.  People come up to me of all different backgrounds. I would say to me, I had no idea that this happened in our country.

I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and it could happen here, and boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.  The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts.

That, for me, was the conspiracy. How did that happen? What was going on there?  That's the. And maybe, maybe, just maybe what happened here is the result of there not being a conspiracy anymore and Eppstein being treated for the first time, just like everyone else.  Donald Trump is not a quitter if you don't count his casinos and marriages and he still has several strategies to win this thing. So let's go through those strategies today. Strategy number one is Trump's first response to anything, whether it's trying to get out of paying a bill or silencing a porn star.  Lawsuits with his path to reelection appearing to be narrowing, President Trump's relying on relief from the courts that may never come filing suits in Michigan and Pennsylvania to stop vote counting until the Trump campaign can access the counting locations. The Trump campaign saying it would request a recount in Wisconsin, where Joe Biden is the apparent winner.  The Trump campaign filing a lawsuit in Georgia alleging one of its poll observers saw late absentee ballots illegally added to a stack of ontime absentee ballots.  And a heavily Democratic county that includes Savannah quite possibly will do a national lawsuit and really expose the corruption of the Democrat Party to a national lawsuit.  So if you are watching this, consider yourself served. And what a difference between twenty sixteen and twenty twenty. When Hillary lost, she disappeared into the woods. But Trump starts losing. He's dragging voters one by one onto the witness stand, although knowing Trump, he's probably just hustling for a big settlement. I'm suing because I should be president. That's why I'm here. But for 500 grand, we can forget this whole thing ever happened. Three hundred thousand, two hundred and fifty.  My final offer. Fifty thousand. I'll pay you, but only twenty dollars. Part of the deal, but what case exactly are they bringing to the courts?  Well, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer and man who drank from the wrong holy grail, explained his objections to counting votes.  Not a single Republican has been able to look at any one of these mail ballots that could be from Mars as far as we're concerned, or they could be from the Democratic National Committee. Joe Biden could have voted 50 times, as far as we know, a five thousand times. You have a reputation for dead people voting. And we're going to go look at just how many dead people voted here. Do you think was stupid? You think we're fools?  Do you think we're fools? Calm down, Count Wexler. First of all, it depends on who you mean by we.  Because if you're talking about you and Trump, then, yes, we do think you're fools. But if you're talking about the entire Trump administration, then also. Yes, because I mean, come on, dude.  Joe Biden isn't voting 5000 times. Have you seen how long the lines have been? Not even Joe Biden wants Joe Biden to be president. Bad enough to wait that long. And that's we're looking into dead people. It's going to be hilarious when Rudy Giuliani is questioning the dead on how they voted, then the Democrats got you to vote for them. No, man, I'm a dead guy just like you.  What? I'm not dead. I'm alive.  Oh, then you should you should get that whole thing checked out that. Oh, no, I'm not going to France. It's really hard to keep track of all of these lawsuits that are happening. But luckily, we've got to say Sloan at the Election Lawsuit Center to help us break it all down. So don't say who is Trump suing right now? Let's take a look.  Trevor, we got a whole bunch of lawsuits coming. In fact, we already know that Trump is suing Pennsylvania and Michigan and Georgia, but he's got even more on the way. Arizona, your ass is getting sued. No better lawyer up. You're getting sued. Utah, your neighbors with Nevada.  Trump's got a still you just because it's convenient to pop by Pennsylvania. That's right. Again, you're getting double snowed. And Trump isn't just suing states.  France, your ass is getting sued for what? Not sure.  See you in court.  Also, Eric Trump said he thought a box of Trump votes in a volcano on Mars. So Mars ready to get a suit. And I almost forgot Pennsylvania trouble suit just for thinking Trump was done suing you. Guess who else Trump is suing?  That's right. Donald Trump is suing itself because if it wasn't for his bullshit, he wouldn't be losing Pennsylvania, which, by the way, trump a suit against quadruple.  So that's what he got so far, Trevor, or should I say defended thirty to see court bench.  Oh, man. I've always wanted to be sued by Trump. Thank you so much for that. Don't say so. It's going to take some time for these lawsuits to be thrown out by a series of lower courts before the Supreme Court does whatever Trump wants. But Trump isn't sitting around waiting. He's also been urging his followers to take to the streets and they're showing up like coronavirus at a White House Rose Garden event.  President Trump supporters in various states are protesting why the Trump campaign won some states to stop counting votes while other states continue counting.  In Arizona overnight, hundreds of Trump supporters similar to gathered outside of Phoenix Election Center, saying the election was being stolen from the president. Protesters there looking to keep the count going as the race tightens the well.  And in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, voters need attention.  There is intense tempers flaring from coast to Coast Guard to be able to steal this election.  The is covering up the crisis. Still disappointed the media's coverage. We want our freedom in a world free of your party.  OK, two things. First, this ugly behavior undermines the foundations of American democracy. And secondly, I hope they have that barbecue beer freedom shirt in a hoodie version that is dope. Also, the Biden crime family.  That has got to be the least threatening sounding organized crime family ever. You know, you've got a really nice place here. Be a pity if some malarkey happened to it. I don't know, I don't know, I mean, seriously, I can't believe we will all terrified that Trump supporters would coordinate a civil war, and yet these guys can't even agree on a slogan to shout in the streets because they're chanting to count the votes if Trump is behind in the states, but then if he's ahead, then they're chanting to stop the counts.  I mean, what happens if the state switches count votes? Well, we are counting and it looks like Joe Biden has just taken the lead. OK, stop counting the votes. We changed our minds. Depends how it goes. But if Trump can't win the election in the streets, he has one final plan to win the election.  In the tweets, the president after Election Day out of sight, but far from quiet, ignoring the ongoing vote count and declaring himself the winner in several crucial battlegrounds. Writing on Twitter, in part, we hereby claim the state of Michigan. But that's not a candidate's call to make.  No, come, Donald. What are you doing then? Just because you shout it doesn't mean it's yours. This is the election not riding shotgun nine. I call. I call, I call White House. And isn't it ironic that Trump spent months warning that rioters were going to loot all the stores, but now he's the one trying to loot the Electoral College? It's all mine. It should have been mine. I wanted it. So they also can we agree that it's adorable how he included the word hereby just to make it sound smarter and more official.  You know, he's like, oh, no, I said hereby. So this is real. You can't use that in twenty twenty. That should only worked back in the day when people were colonizing land. I declared this land property of Her Majesty the Queen. This is our land. We will kill you. Well, then I hereby declare this land property of Her Majesty the Queen. Guys, he said hereby, there's nothing we can do not stand back and stand by.  Oh, craftier. But if none of these plans work and Donald Trump can't stop Joe Biden from becoming president, we'll all is not lost for the GOP because it turns out that Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader and world's most powerful bull SEC, has got a plan to take care of Biden even if he wins.  Axios has a good piece out today about McConnell arguing that if he keeps the majority, he will force Biden to keep his cabinet choices. Centrist McConnell is already lining up his troops to be ready to make things difficult for the Bush administration, looking to control the type of cabinet the fighting can assemble, the type of hearings that he can have.  Mitch McConnell is going to be asked and Republicans in the Senate will be a blocking force.  That's where doesn't matter who is president, although been a cock block or in.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about AOC Recounts Capitol Riot Attack | Ibram X. Kendi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many people feel like this is a new opportunity for America. Joe Biden has said on multiple occasions that racism is going to be at the forefront of his agenda, which has drawn him a lot of criticism.  What would you hope that he would do actually do that could move America forward in achieving that racial equality? Well, one thing he's doing with the coronavirus is he's he continues to say that he's going to put science before politics. And so as it relates to racial inequity and injustice, if he was to put silence science before politics, if he was to essentially look at what scholars are saying, how we can eliminate inequities and injustices, how we can reduce or eliminate police, not necessarily be as concerned about white swing voters or even Republican voters, that I think he would be able to make some serious advances in rooting out racism.  But the fact of the matter is, is the irony is the very folks who support racist policies that drive us apart through inequities, who support racist policies, that maintain racial injustice, that causes people to be killed by police, which then leads to mass demonstrations, are the very people trying to claim we're divisive. Right. And that's the that's the that's the fundamental fallacy. We want to equality brings people together last night.  Well, I will say this. It will always be a journey.

OK, now listen, this may be the case, A.J., and it's Tambien, and we're giving great, bad advice. Never give a bad, great advice on our new show. We Talk Back. Yeah, talking about a whole lot of sex. I love the sex and a bunch of money. We love the money in relationships. We don't work on it. It feels like. Yes. And listen to we talk back every Thursday on the radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your packages.  My name is Redock. I am Ellen Bernstein. Brodsky, this is called your grandmother. What's the matter with you?  Well, and it is a podcast about the relationship between grandmothers and grandchildren, as my mother would have said, TACA, who wouldn't have wanted a Jewish grandmother?  Sometimes she accidentally live. Streams were like, who going to tell her?  I'm just hearing about this now. Listen to your grandmother on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  The big issue right now is getting people vaccinated as quickly as possible. And now there's yet another thing making that harder than it should be assholes.  The Los Angeles Times says dozens of anti vaccination protesters disrupted operations at one of the largest vaccine sites in the country. They blocked entrances and forced the inoculation center at Dodger Stadium to close for about an hour Saturday. Hundreds of people waited in their cars to get shots. Some city officials are calling for increased security at testing and vaccination locations.  Whoa. These people in L.A. had to sit in their cars for an hour. How did they notice what all the real the what the fuck t vexes if you don't want the vaccine and don't get one.  I don't agree with you, but don't ruin it for everyone else. Like we don't come interrupt you when you're busy dying of measles, because here's what I don't understand. Why does it always have to be the most ridiculous people who are the most fired up? Like why can't anti vaccines be like those Instagram models were last summer, you know, with just post a black square on Instagram for one day and then they bring up vaccines again.  Western Australia went into total lockdown after discovering its first coronavirus case in 10 months. You see, Australia is very different from the United States in the US. Water goes down the drain clockwise, and in Australia, they care about stopping coronavirus. Now, part of the reason for Australia's success is that Australians don't resist the government as much when they tell them that they should stay at home. And it's partly because these people know that covid is a serious disease.  It's also partly because it lets Australians stay away from all the other things in Australia that could kill them. And it's bad enough that the scorpions and snakes are trying to kill me. But there's a koala that's trying to get me in every day. Now, eventually, of course, the world will reemerge from the pandemic.  And I know everyone thinks that they're going to jump right back into their old lives, you know, like going to bars or theatres or using the bottom half of your face to express emotion. But you might want to prepare for a period of adjustment because some things apparently take a little time to relearn.  A new report says some pilots are getting rusty on the job due to the pandemic because, well, there are fewer planes to fly. Some pilots grounded for months by the pandemic have seen the skills and proficiency suffer. For instance, one pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake, damaging a tow truck that was trying to pull that plane from the gate. In another case, the pilot, while forgot to turn on the empty icing mechanism. Other reports include lining up the wrong runway for landing.  To counter such rustiness, the FAA stops pilots from flying a commercial jet unless they have performed at least three takeoffs and three landings, either on a plane or in a simulator in the previous 90 days.  I don't know about you, but this is kind of scary. Apparently, you never forget how to ride a bike, but you forget how to fly a plane after like five days. Oh, man, this is going to change everything. Next time the plane hits turbulence, the pilot's going to jump on the intercom like, are there any hijackers on board?  We need someone who knows how to fly the plane. Harpreet, any hijackers, please make yourself known to the cabin crew.  And listen, I get that pilots are human and everyone makes mistakes at their jobs, but there are certain jobs where there is way less room for error. You know, like as a mail carrier, you might say, oh, whoops, this package was supposed to go to apartment two and accidentally sent it to apartment three. But as a pilot, it's more like a Poopsie. These people were supposed to go to Miami and I accidentally sent them to heaven.  And trust me, now, this is not just going to be pilots, people. Everyone is going to be rusty off to covid projectionists are going to be showing movies upside down. Bouncers are going to be letting in groups of ugly dudes and telling beautiful women they got on the wrong shoes. Bullies are going to give you their lunch money.  Until the pandemic is actually over, Americans are going to need more help getting through it and the big question of what that help will look like is dominating Washington, D.C. right now.  President Biden's pledge of bipartisanship facing its first test tonight. The president inviting 10 Republican senators to the Oval Office to pitch their covid relief counteroffer. Their six hundred billion dollar proposal is a mere fraction of the president's one point nine dollars trillion dollar package. The GOP plan leaves out a minimum wage boost. The president includes and whittles down his fourteen hundred dollar direct payments to Americans to one thousand dollars.  Still, when all was said and done, the White House did not appear to be conceding much ground, saying the president will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.  This is a sign of this effort from President Biden to get bipartisanship here. But it also comes as Democrats on Capitol Hill are paving the way to move forward with only Democratic votes for this relief package.  Look, man, I'm not going to lie. I get why Democrats and Republicans are having trouble agreeing on this relief package. I mean, this is a difference of one point three trillion dollars. How do you compromise when you're that far apart? It's like deciding what you want to get for dinner and you want something nice, but your date wants to eat out of a gas station, trash can. You can't compromise and eat out of a nice trash can.  But I also do love how Republicans suddenly get stingy the second that a Democrat comes into office, because don't forget, during the Trump years, they were handing out tax cuts with a strip of money gun. But now that Biden is president, suddenly they're trying to hand out covid relief a penny at a time, one penny to OpenEdge. Am I making it rain yet? Three pennies? Yes. More of a drizzle. I agree. Now, a lot of people are upset about the Democrats plan to give people fourteen hundred dollars because they say that the Democrats promised to give people two thousand dollars.  But the Democrats are arguing that everybody already got the first six hundred a month ago. And I get the Democrats point on this one. But at the same time, so many people are struggling right now. Why not just give them twenty six hundred instead? I mean, you can find the money somewhere. Just take it from spaceports. Trump is gone. We don't have to pretend that that's a thing anymore.  Hey, guys, Ben Bass here. And I'm the creator of a crazy little show called BLAW Concern for Comedy Central Digital. And I'm Christopher Hitchens, plus the voice of Clarkson, whose name is well, son, we made this insane show at the studio that makes robot chicken.  Markinson is a mixed media puppet show that follows an overly manly father named Blac, who desperately tries to connect with his overly nerdy son.  He got some really cool people involved just in Royal and Donald Faison, Jane Lynch, Jim Rash, Debra Baker, Jr..  It's a really fun show that we're really proud of, and it's available right now on Comedy Central's YouTube channel.  So go check it out. Children, they like puppies that walk on two legs, but with the pandemic, taking care of them is harder than ever. And guess which gender has been settled with that burden?  With child care, crisis is pushing working moms out of the labor force. More than two million women have left the workforce in the US since this pandemic began. When you look at that December jobs report on a net basis, women made up all of the job losses, losing one hundred fifty six thousand jobs. Men net gained sixteen thousand.  Even before the pandemic, women shouldered more household chores when schools shut down and daycares closed. Many women felt they had no choice but returned to jobs as homemakers.  Burnout among working moms who are juggling it all.  The home school, the child care and the demanding jobs headphones are not working right now, so I'm spending my day working while here in the square.  In the background, I usually get about an hour or so of uninterrupted time. So there is also the fun fact that my son is in band and they have to virtually and I feel so bad for that mom.  She's got to work with her kid playing French horn in the background.  Honestly speaking, all brass instruments should be illegal. No one's ever said car horns are great, but how do we bring them indoors? But look, if your kid has to play a brass instrument, then you should make sure that it's a trombone, because at least that way they can provide sound effects for your Zoome. Cause I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Chairman, but our revenue is down this quarter, thanks to me.  You've got to admit, Mom's taking on so much more these days, working home schooling their kids, running a house. It's a very different pandemic experience than childless people are having because childless people, their complaints are like, oh, man, I wasted all day watching Netflix again. I didn't even get to Hulu. Oh, man, what a tough day. But while Korona has exacerbated these problems, child care has been a major issue in America. Long before everyone started wiping down their junk mail.  It's the subject of another episode of If You Don't Know Now you know.  Let's be honest, people, America is great at many things, rebooting British TV shows, making anything flaming hot, but providing parents with childcare isn't one of them, and the consequences are felt throughout the entire country.  The U.S. is one of the only developed countries that does not have free care for young children. Overall, the cost of child care has roughly tripled since 1990, which is more than the overall rate of inflation.  The average cost of care per child is more than twenty six thousand dollars per year for parents and parts of the USA. That's more than housing and college tuition.  Childcare costs can wipe out or nearly wipe out any economic benefit the woman would get from working. As a result, women will often stay out of the workforce to care for their child.  This is going to cost upwards of seven hundred billion dollars this year to the US economy in terms of lost productivity. That's three point five percent of GDP.  Labor participation rate of women in the United States kept pace with top countries in this area. Like Norway, for instance, our economy would be one point six trillion dollars larger. Better child care is a win for everybody. There's just no downside to it.  That's right. It turns out this burden isn't just on moms. It directly impacts the entire country. America is missing out on economic growth, equality and probably invention's know like a combination refrigerator toilets. America could have had that by now if the woman who had the idea didn't have to quit her engineering job to take care of her kids. And not only does this hurt women's productivity, it also hurts men's productivity, because if women aren't in the office, then men have to spend all day mansplaining stuff to each other.  Hey, Bob, Bob, let me show you how to turn that file into a PDF. Hey, Gary, how about I show you how to save it onto the network drive? No, silly. You got a formatted correctly. Here, let me show you. Hey, do you know all the formatting shortcuts here? Let me teach you. Have you seen a Coen Brothers movie? I mean, like really seen it. Quentin Tarantino. Now, the truth is this child care problem isn't actually that difficult to solve.  All you got to do is let kids get jobs. I mean, a textile mill is just arts and crafts with quotas. But there's also another less illegal solution for child care that other countries have figured out a long time ago. You let the government pay for it.  The cost of child care is generally paid for by a combination of the government, parents and child care providers. In the US, the cost falls mostly on parents and providers in other countries like Denmark and Sweden, the government foots most of the bill.  In Sweden, tax revenue supports generous childcare programs and gives employees vast leave of absence opportunities. Those programs, in turn, helped make Swedish citizens more employable. They also don't have to ration big portions of their paychecks to things like daycare or student loans.  In Finland, the government offers public daycare for any child until the age of seven, or if the parents decide to opt out, they're entitled to paid leave the first three years of their kid's life. The French government offers a family allowance every month to help pay for child expenses all the way up until the kids 20th birthday.  On top of all this, families get tax credits for daycare and schooling expenses. It's a generous system that cost the state tens of billions of euros each year, a high cost that's worth it.  The more active women are in the workforce, the more they have babies. And more babies means more future workers and future taxpayers.  OK, I mean, that makes sense. But it's a little weird for that lady to refer to babies as future workers and taxpayers. I wonder she rolls up to her new nieces and nephews like, are you going to grow our GDP?  Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Although just for the record, she's not totally right. If the past four years have taught us anything, it's that not all kids work. But look, overall, I think these countries have it right. And it's actually sad when you see Americans get shocked when they learn how other countries handle child care, when they get three years of parental leave in Finland.  That's crazy, but it's not crazy.  It's just that other countries expect the government to make life easier for its citizens. Over there, they say, wow, it's hard to raise kids. Let's have the government help. Only America goes, wow, it's hard to raise kids, but the government needs all the money for drones and tax cuts. So sorry, Susie, I hope this iPad can raise you.  But the craziest part is we know America is capable of giving everyone access to child care because they've already done it.  Back when everything was in black and white, when World War Two came, the government started recruiting women to work in factories as the. And went out to work on the production line, Rosie the Riveter steps in when the draftees step out from 1940 to 1945, the total women in the workforce rose nearly 30 percent.  And they very brilliantly realized that if women had children, something had to be done for the children. So this was the first and only time that the American government, the federal at the federal level said, OK, we have to support child care. Essentially, the U.S. was the closest it had ever been to having universal child care. An amendment to the Lanham Act gave families access to child care six days a week, including summers and holidays. And families only had to pay roughly ten dollars a day in today's dollars.  But once the war ended and the men went back to work, government funding dried up."}]}

Today is Tuesday, the 1st of December. We made it to December, which means there's only 50 days left until Donald Trump leaves the White House and has to start doing his own laundry again. Anyway, coming up on tonight's show, Melania Saves Christmas Space. Aliens are stealing our ideas. And Rosie Perez joins me on the show. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with terminal.  Right now, it feels like the only story that matters every day is the coronavirus.  It's taken over all of our news, all of our attention, you know, like like some sort of virus. But believe it or not, there is still a ton of other news going on in the world right now. So let's catch up on some of it in today's edition of Headlines.  Let's kick it off with Melania Trump, first lady of the United States and the only Trump family member who's already in prison, you might remember that the last time Melania made news, it was because an ex friend of hers leaked a recording of her, which made her sound a lot like a Slovenian Scrooge.  I'm working like a as far as I know, Christmas stuff that, you know, some of stuff. It's a crazy, but I need to do it right.  OK, I think we can all agree that is not a good look, especially in America. The only decorations Americans love more than Christmas with those candles that smell like desserts and those bowls of dry flowers that look like a snack, they are not a snack. So after that leaked recording came out, it was obviously important that this year Melania made it clear that she really, really does give a fuck about Christmas.  And it looks like she rose to the occasion and she may have less than two months to go in the White House.  But Melania Trump is decking the halls today. The first lady unveiled this year's White House Christmas decorations and she avoided any controversy with a traditionally festive look.  Just released video from first lady Melania shows the halls filled with festive decorations. The theme for her final holiday season at the White House is America the Beautiful. Each room has its own color scheme, and the Christmas trees are adorned with crafts made by children from all 50 states.  There are plenty of traditional style decorations of trees with white lights and red ornaments. There's also a village hospital to honor front line workers amid the pandemic.  Oh, they even have a little ornament hospital. Given how crowded the real hospitals are right now, that one better get ready to start taking tiny patients. But on the real, though, I think that's a beautiful tribute to health care providers. I mean, it is a little strange that the Christmas decorations acknowledge covid more than the administration has, but still it is something. But at the same time, I kind of feel bad for millennia. Yeah, because I think she was right in the first place.  No one cares that much about Christmas decorations.  And before you say, oh, you do. Yeah, yeah, you say that. But you have one tree. She has to decorate the entire White House.  If you had to decorate one hundred rooms, you'd also end up being like these Christmas stuff. But now, because she was busted, Melania has to be more Christmas than even Mariah Carey. Are you happy people now? It looks like Christmas total up all over my house. And you can tell this thing, Godchaux, because she definitely won more traditional this year with the decorations. I mean, remember twenty eighteen, those Christmas trees that she died with goat blood and twenty seventeen, that was even crazier.  She just spray painted. Santa is not real on the walls. That was, that was pretty out there. But let's move on from the Trump administration to another endangered species, sea turtles, because contrary to popular belief, being a turtle is not easy, my friends. I mean, yeah, that shell keeps predators out, but it also makes it hard to let anyone in. But luckily, this week, some of these little guys caught a little break.  Well, it's not only people who flock to Florida in cold weather. 40 sea turtles were flown to the Florida Keys from Cape Cod yesterday after suffering what's known as cold, stunning after they were exposed to frigid water for too long, the Kemp's Ridley sea turtles are considered a critically endangered species. A group of private pilots called turtles fly to donated their time, aircraft and fuel to help the cold blooded creatures recover. The turtles will be returned to the ocean in time for mating season.  Tell me that is not adorable. These turtles were freezing, but now because they're in Florida, they're nice and warm and they all have STDs. And did you see them getting put into that banana box to fly? Oh, they look like a little bunch of sperm airline customers, Spirit Airlines, even the turtles don't get enough legroom. I will say, though, this whole flying them somewhere else is going to make a lot of other animals jealous because it was probably a duck migrating that looked in the plane like, oh, hell no, I'm going to fly myself.  In fact, I'm a little jealous. I mean, I'm freezing my ass off, too, but nobody's flying me down to Florida for free.  I also want to go spread covered in the club.  I will say, though, this story really gives you an interesting insight into our society, because if a turtle gets flown down to warmer weather, they call that preservation. But if an Instagram model gets the same thing, she's called a ho double standard, much moving on from the ocean to the deserts.  And the big mystery that has everyone talking, the mystery of the silver monolith that seemed to appear out of nowhere in the Utah desert has deepened. It has now mysteriously disappeared. It's not known he removed it.  So do we think it's aliens? It's aliens, isn't it? Got to be if you weren't thinking that this was aliens, you may now I think it's aliens.  Yeah, if aliens are going to come down to earth, 20, 20 would be. You're right. This would be the one.  OK, people, I can't believe I have to say this, but clearly this is not aliens, right? This is somebody ripping off 2001 A Space Odyssey. Unless it is aliens and they're ripping off two thousand one, that will be really depressing.  Imagine if you found out that aliens just get all their ideas from watching our movies. You know, they're going to make contact with humans and be like I am next the wise and this is my way. But here's my question. Why are we so desperate to discover aliens, guys?  Hmm? Do you know much crazy shit is already down on earth, have you guys seen a platypus? We've seen a volcano. I mean, just look at this fish, look at this fish and tell me it doesn't look like an alien. That's about a torture. Princess Leia.  And now, your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base. And if this is supposed to be some abstract art, then you know what, it belongs in the desert. Keep that garbage out of sight. I'm tired of artists putting up random shit and then saying, oh, it's a comment on the human condition. No matter, it's a spoon. Save the space for art that actually speaks to the mysteries of life and nature.  Know like those dogs playing poker. What were they playing for? High stakes. I will say, though, it is really strange that this monolith just disappeared without a trace, because not where it's gone, we'll never know.  Where do you want us to put this giant flag thing? Yeah, you could put it in the bedroom, please. Thank you. We'll just never know. Moving on to the other global pandemic that just won't go away. Racism.  We all know how videos of police brutality have led to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement here in the United States.  But it turns out similar uprisings are happening all over the world, most recently in France.  French politicians are to rewrite part of a controversial security bill amid national outrage over a police assault on a black man. Evidence of the officers beating music producer Michel ZECHER in his Paris studio was captured on CCTV.  There have been several protests in Paris and other cities across the country against Article 24 of the bill, which will regulate how people should feel photos of police. Critics fear the new law could stop people exposing police brutality.  So it turns out France was about to possible that outlawed sharing videos of the police. But now that the police were caught on video beating an unarmed black man, they're going to try and rewrite that bill. So in a way that was very good timing on that beating, because imagine if it had happened after the law had passed, that guy would have been like, they beat me for being black or no. Do you have video? No, because it's illegal to have video to bed without the video.  It did not happen. You can see that. But we don't know without the video. But this just goes to show you whether it's America, France or Nigeria. The official government line is always that police brutality is not a problem. Then time and time again, we discover video evidence that shows otherwise. So it's really no surprise that the French government wanted to ban filming. I mean, it's easier to gaslight the public when there's no evidence to the contrary.  But that's exactly why the French need to be able to film their police so that they can prove this. And because France makes better police brutality videos, I mean, they've got artistic angles. You know, the black and white, the melancholy music, I it's very sophisticated.  And finally, we're now about one month away from the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. I know. Crazy, right?  It feels like it was just yesterday when we were punching grannies for toilet paper, but it'll still be at least six months before there's enough vaccine for everybody, which means the fight is now on to elbow your way to the front of the line.  Today, a CDC advisory panel is meeting to vote on recommendations about who will get the vaccines first once they're approved by the FDA, but only enough medicine for about 20 million people expected by the end of this year.  Authorities are having to prioritize. Already, health officials have said that seniors with underlying health conditions and doctors who treat covid patients should be put at the front of the line will ultimately be up to state and local officials to choose where the doses go first.  Oh, this is going to be the big drama of twenty twenty one. Who is going to get priority for the vaccine? Because, look, everyone agrees that the first groups who should get this vaccine should be the frontline health care workers. Right. Then should be people named Trevor, then seniors.  Very important to protect our seniors, then people named Trevor again. I mean, in case the first time didn't take. And then we protect those who have pre-existing, like, you know, the people. We just got to get the order. Right. And I know they're going to prioritize people based on risk and health.  But if you ask me, America has already figured out the best way to decide how to distribute rewards. And that's right. I'm talking about Vaccine Ninja Warrior.  Oh, yeah. Who wants to survive? All right.  We're going to take a quick break. But when we come back, Joe Biden is selecting his cabinet. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is fleecing his fans. Stay tuned to find out how.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. For the past month, the two big stories in politics have been Joe Biden preparing to step into the presidency without breaking more bones and Donald Trump refusing to step down from the presidency because he insists on keeping the White House Hulu accounts.  So let's see where things stand in our somehow still ongoing coverage of vote chasm 20 20.  Let's begin with President elect Biden. America's control alt delete. He's been assembling his new administration and it looks like he's putting his best foot forward. Well, I guess he's only working foot, but it's still pretty impressive.  President elect Joe Biden is unveiling key members of his foreign policy and national security team today. The players are familiar from the Obama administration and notable for their diversity. If confirmed, Alejandro Mayorkas will be the first Latino and immigrant to serve as secretary of Homeland Security. Avril Haines will be the first female director of national intelligence. And Linda Thomas Greenfield, a career diplomat, is nominated to represent the United States at the U.N.. Mr. Biden also announced his new White House communications team.  It is a diverse all female group, including several mothers of young kids.  Now that is progressive and all women communications team and a national security team that is racially diverse. People all over the Middle East are going to be like, what an honor, what an honor to be bombed by such a WOAK administration and a communications team of all women will be a refreshing change. Because let's be honest, guys, men always lying about size to try and impress people. Don't be fooled. This team isn't as diverse as it seems on the surface.  For example, all of these people have experience in their fields. Everyone's experienced.  The Trump administration would never have tolerated this kind of discrimination against incompetence. Shame on you, Joe Biden. Shame on you. Meanwhile, on the other side of reality, Donald Trump's attempt to cling to office faced another setback yesterday when Wisconsin and Arizona became the latest states to formally certify Biden's victory. And the Arizona ceremony happened at a particularly awkward moment for Donald Trump.  As the governor was signing the certification documents, his cell phone buzzed with the ring tone of Hail to the Chief. Deucy has previously said he set that song for calls coming from the White House. This time, he muted the phone and set it aside as he signed documents that made Trump's loss official.  Who? That is called sending the president of the United States to voicemail like he's spam, which he is, but still, you know, Fox and Friends are watching this like, oh, that's a good trick.  We can just not answer the phone. We've got to try that. And you know, what made this move, especially gangster, is that he knew Trump was watching him on live TV. We've all had that moment where we think somebody is ignoring our call or our text.  But to actually see it, to see him, look at his phone, see your name, and then put it away.  Oh. That had to hurt Trump was probably sitting there like, this is so painful, I've got to call Melania and tell her how bad it hurts.  I guess millennials can come to the phone right now, and as upsetting as those losses are for Trump, it's even more frustrating for Trump supporters because they must be wondering how their guy can possibly still be losing, especially after they've donated tons of money for the legal battles against the rigged election."}]}

But then once the war was over, America just got rid of it, which is not fair to moms. And it's going to make them a lot more hawkish when it comes to war. The next time America's got tension with Iran, American moms are going to be like, come on, come on, Ayatollah, you got to make this happen.  So the point is, better childcare is possible in America and it would be great if America took advantage of this global war against the coronavirus to make childcare available for everyone, because if America misses this opportunity to act, it'll continue to let down its moms, dads and worst of all, it's children.

Hi, this is Bill Clinton, please join me on why am I telling you, why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this?  Why am I telling you this?  Because it is your future on the line. From listening to my relatives and neighbors around the kitchen table or at my grandfather's store, I learned that everyone has a story and that everyone's story has value. Once you've heard a person's hopes and fears where they've been and where they want to go, your differences sort of slip away after years of being interviewed.  I'm looking forward to doing the interviewing, to having conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know and sharing stories that have shaped our lives. We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future.  Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and if you're like me, you're probably worried right now, in part because of the fascist insurrection on January 6th in Washington, D.C. But what if I were to tell you that what happened in D.C. was just the latest in more than a century of fascist attempts to take over democratic governments, many of them successful, learn about the history of these insurrections and the history of the anti fascist actions attempting to stop them.  When you listen to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. This has been a Comedy Central podcast now."}]}

Well, hello, everybody, welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show, I am Trevor Noah, running on four hours of sleep. Today is Wednesday, the 4th of November, which means we're now on day two of Election Day. It's almost like a Hanukkah miracle that no one wanted anyway. Coming up on tonight's show, we look at how Donald Trump has had it with all of these votes.  Roy Wood Junior will never trust the polls again. And we'll find out why Hispanic voters are going mad. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with criminal issues.  So Election Day is over, but because it's 20, 20, Election Week has just begun. And that means it's time for more election coverage in our continuing segment, Vote Chasm 20 20, The Awkward Day OFDA.  Let's kick it off with really the only news right now. Joe Biden looks like he is on pace to become the forty sixth president of the United States. Not the time that I'm seeing this. He's leading in enough states to win the entire thing and it might even be declared tonight. In fact, you might even know watching this right now, if the election is over and if you do, please don't tell me no spoilers. I like this feeling of stress.  Now, this is all happening after a chaotic, nerve wracking election night that featured all types of weird moments, predictions flipping left and right, ballots being delivered with a police escort, Steve Kanakis Kalki. But but maybe what's weirdest is that after all of that, the night actually ended up going mostly as everyone expected. You know, Trump jumped ahead early and a lot of states because Republicans mostly voted in person and those votes got counted first.  And then as the Democratic mail in ballots came in, Biden jumped ahead, which is what everyone knew might happen for weeks when everyone except the president of the United States, we were winning everything and all of a sudden it was just called off.  The results tonight have been phenomenal. And we are getting ready. I mean, literally, we were just all set to get outside and just celebrate something that was so beautiful, so good. We had such a big night. You just take a look at all of these states that we've won tonight, and then you take a look at the kind of margins that we've won. But we won states and all of a sudden I said, what happened to the election?  It's off. And we have all these announcers saying, what happened?  And then they said, oh, yeah, dude, because first they counted your votes and now they're counting the other guy's votes. I mean, I knew that Trump didn't like science, but I didn't realize he had disavowed numbers. I mean, maybe this explains why he's always in debt. This is just a level of stupidity from Trump that I did not expect. He always exceeds the levels of stupidity and you can go higher. Sometimes it feels like Trump is an actual toddler.  First I had a nose, then suddenly my uncle stole it and I had no nose. What happened? You know, normal folks, I don't have a nose anymore. Although Trump could be playing four dimensional chess here. Yeah, maybe he's laying the groundwork for his legal defense over his taxes. Your Honor, as you can see, I have no idea how our numbers work. Therefore, I cannot be held accountable. Case dismissed, sir. You cannot dismiss your own case.  I also don't know how the law works. Double case dismissed. Hashtag winning. But yeah, needless to say, Donald Trump was upset. The more votes got counted, the more Biden pulled ahead of him. And for Donald Trump, they could only be one solution. Stop counting the votes.  Something just breaking in the last couple of minutes as well. Things are moving fast and furiously with the president's campaign. The campaign manager, Bill Stepien, announcing that the Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit in the state of Michigan, saying President Trump's campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots in the counting process is guaranteed by Michigan law. We have filed suit today in the Michigan court of claims to halt counting.  This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country.  We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.  This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at four o'clock in the morning and add them to the list, OK?  It's it's a very sad it's a very sad moment to me, this is a very sad moment and we will win this. And as far as I'm concerned, we already have one.  Wow. I know everyone was expecting it, but still, can we just take a moment to admit that it is insane that an American president is just demanding that they stop that they stop counting votes while he's ahead? This is a textbook authoritarian move, which is impressive coming from a guy who's never read a textbook. And I got to say, for a guy who hates shithole countries, Trump really likes Jack this style. I mean, I never thought I'd see the day when someone yelling at me to go back to Africa sounded more like a concern for my rights instead of a threat.  All I'm saying is, be careful, America. If you let Trump do this, then voting could soon become one of those things that people do to feel better but doesn't actually do anything, you know, like taking CBD oil or recycling plastic. Now, look, nobody knows what the Supreme Court is going to decide if Trump ends up bringing this case to them. I mean, we hope that they'll be neutral and rule on the merits. But I mean, Trump is also the person who appointed so many of them that who knows?  I mean, they might just be like, according to the Constitution, only the president gets to be president. So then how do you get a new president? But let's move on to the other big news of election night, which is actually very bad news for Democrats. It looks like Republicans will very likely be holding on to the Senate.  And some high profile races really did not turn out the way Democrats wanted, even when they spent a lot of money.  Minutes after the polls closed in Kentucky, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell winning reelection for his seventh term. Democrat Amy McGrath, giving McConnell a challenging fight, smashing fundraising records. Her campaign spending more than 70 million dollars on the race. In South Carolina, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham holding on to his Senate seat after Harrison raised more than one hundred million dollars in his campaign.  God damn. I don't know who the bigger losers are here, the Democratic candidates or the donors who gave them one hundred and seventy million dollars to lose their races. I mean, those donors gave them the best possible chance and they still lost. That's like your parents being billionaires, but you still end up as dongjun. But shit, if you can raise that much money, will the next time I'm going to run for Senate against Mitch McConnell.  All right, everybody, if I'm going to beat this guy, I'm going to need a new Tesla, the new five and also two hundred GS for snacks and stuff. I think I got this people. And, you know, on one level, I guess it is an encouraging story. It's an encouraging story about the limits of money in politics because it means you could have all the money in the world, but it can't buy you the charisma of Mitch McConnell.  So overall, even if Biden does manage to pull off a victory in the next few days or hours, Democrats are still a bit shell shocked. They didn't do as well as they were hoping and they didn't even do as well as they thought they would.  Trump did have a better night than expected, outperforming the polls once again. President Trump has actually exceeded his 2016 numbers in every single demographic with gender and race except for white men. He exceeded his white women vote blacks, Hispanics with black women and black men.  Once again, the polls and the entire political world in Washington, D.C. and New York totally missed the scale of of the Democrats underperformance last night. I'm going to pop over here to Wisconsin. There was a poll from ABC the other day that had Joe Biden up 17 points in this state. Look where you are right now. It's seventy one percent of the vote. And Trump's got a lead here by four points.  The polling was wrong. It was wrong. Again, even worse than it was in twenty sixteen.  The polling was even worse than in twenty sixteen. How do the polls just keep getting worse? One of the New York Knicks. But that's right, the Democrats had super high expectations last night and they badly underperformed. Basically, the Democrats are the Sinabung of politics. It smells amazing. You get excited, but once you're eating it, you're like, oh yeah, Cinnabon.  For more on what went down last night. Let's turn to a man who was up all night, Roy Wood, Jr.. What's going on, Roy?  No, man. What's going on, man?  You know, this race between Biden and Trump is a lot tighter than anyone was expecting.  This race is tighter than one of Donald Trump's t shirts. Look, first of all, we've got to give it up to Trump. First and foremost. Let's just just look at everything he did. He teamed up with Coronavirus to kill people. He got everybody hating. Everybody managed to pay less taxes than Lauryn Hill and somehow still be in this race. That's crazy, dude. Man, I wrote one bad check to Circuit City. They still won't let me back in the snow, and they had a business.  So then what's the lesson here, man? Well, I'll tell you what the lesson is for me. The lesson for me is to stop trusting the polls. I'm done. I'm done trusting people. You watch all these polls running, they mouth about Biden. Did have you thinking Biden was going to win Florida, Texas, Mexico, diamond and silk. I'm done. I'm done with all these polls, man.  It's a slice. I'm telling you right now, I'm never trusting polls again, but Roy, we talked about this in twenty sixteen, you said you weren't going to trust the polls again, that I am bringing up all that old shit, man.  Yes, I said that, yes. But then the pollsters, they said that we could trust them again. So I did. Plus they have four years to fix it. So silly me for thinking that they may have actually had some changes to the damn polling system, you know, just like I got to Mexicans, but I go to. Right. And they always get shut down for health violations. But the food. So I let it slide.  When you go back in there, they shut down for a little while. You go back in there and you be like, oh, they cleaned it up. Nope. It's the same old stuff. Only nice to do when a different apron. So you're not going to ever try and predict elections again, right? No, I will try to predict elections again. Only now I will be using more reliable predictions like astrology or the reading the entrails of a guinea pig or or like on the night of a full moon going outside your and seen of my pee, making any type of words or letters I can read them in a Ouija board.  Well, I mean, another option is you could you could always just try and talk to people of different communities and try and suss out their perspective of the world.  Yeah, I said I said talk to astrologists. That's what I said. You know, listening.  OK, but just so we're on the same page, you're done with polls.  Yes, I am done with the update, Suzanne.  Oh, shit, they talk about dynamite win Texas, we did it baby by night with Texas. Boy, I don't think we had a real quick manual. I'm saying this is good news right here, Roy.  Right. Those are pollsters again. Roy, you come. Roy, why not just wait for the results?  ROY No, no, man. I've got to put it up. I've got to go. I've got to spread the good news to everybody on the Internet. Man, this is good. Hey, we back in Atlanta.  Why is he phoning the Internet? All right. Well, thanks for that, Roy. No need to break his heart again today. All right. We're going to take a quick break. But when we come back, we'll be talking about all the election results that weren't about the president. And spoiler alert, if you're in Jersey, it's time to get high.  You don't want to miss it. Hey, what's up? This is Adam Devine andas home Blake Anderson and Kyle Neurogenic, and you might recognize these sweet, sultry voices from the hit television program, Workaholic.

What is happening? Traceroute called it.  Wow, I never thought I'd see this day. So Fox News, pro Biden, now Wellmont, pro Biden.  But there they're definitely bivy, curious. Either way, it looks like it's splitsville for Fox News and Donald Trump. And I'd be worried if I were FOX, because if there's one thing Trump actually has experience in, it's dumping blond's.  I mean, either way, though, looks like Trump's supporters can't be happy to see his favorite news network abandon him. What do you think Trump supporters are going to do?  Well, they'll take some time to process the loss, maybe disconnect from the media for a while, the curl up with a good novel and consider that maybe they'd be happy.  You're not living in a constant state of seething rage and grievance.  Oh, that actually sounds nice. Do you think that's really what they'll do? No. They're finding somewhere else to guzzle their cocktail of made up bullshit. Right wing fanatics have fled like this since they were buying tickets to Argentina at the end of World War Two. And lucky for them, small outlets like Newsmax, TV and OEM are offering a new place to call home.  Trump won the election. Hell, he won. And the only thing Democrats can do is trick all of us into believing he didn't stop declaring Biden as the winner because it ain't over yet.  They are trying to convince us that Joe Biden have more of the popular vote than any other president in history. Mathematically, that's impossible, right?  Right now, Joe Biden is pretending to be the president elect and it's OK elect Joe Biden.  I don't think so. I just don't think so. It doesn't look right. It doesn't sound right. Doesn't feel right.  You remember the heavyweight champion, Joe Frazier. He died eight years ago. He voted two years ago. The actor Will Smith has a grandfather who died about four years ago. He's voted in the last two elections and that number now is growing. I think it's up to seven hundred dead people who voted in Philadelphia.  God isn't a great treasurer. Joe Frazier and Will Smith's granddad are voting together. It's amazing how exciting the news can be when you just make it up.  OK, but but, Lewis, this is the first time I've ever heard of these channels. Like, is anyone really watching them?  Oh, you bet your liberal bubble ass they are. These networks is thriving. At the end of October, Newsmax averaged sixty five thousand viewers. But just a week after the election, some of these shows are breaking up a million viewers. That's Korona level growth. And good luck trying to vaccinate against stupid Phizer. And Trever, when I see how the right wing media is exploiting its gullible viewers, it makes me sad and also jealous. I want in.  You want. And what does that even mean, Lewis?  It means I'm starting my own network. You saw Newsmax in 08 and look like all it takes is a few bargain-basement graphics, no editorial standards and a tenuous grip on reality. This is the job I was born for. Check it out.  Are you sick of those commies at Fox News spewing their left wing propaganda? Then sign up for Newsmax TV. You get the political insights you crave from the angriest man on TV. The Democratic Party is trying. You're right now with Newsmax TV. You know what to think about all of today's newsmakers like you see Jason Carville, Joe Biden Jr., I think he would make a great president. I can't believe what I do for money, and it's not just politics, Newsmax will give you the whether the liberal media won't tell you about this hurricane because the whole was the wind you can here.  So it's not real and all the sports you can handle. I don't trust NBA players, and I think you know why. The black stuff. Oh, yeah, he just said that out loud. Other networks will imply, but this point gets forty nine.  Ninety nine a month or fifty nine. Ninety nine. If you want the shirtless version. So sign up today for Newsmax TV. Give me your money. How about a driver? Right now, we've got a deal, 12 months for the price of 50.  Yeah, I'm going to have to think about it, Lewis. That's all right. Get your credit card number. What how did you how did you get a card by now, Lewis? How did you get my credit card, Lewis? All right, I'm going to go cancel my credit card, but when we come back, Congresswoman Lucy McBath tells me about how Democrats can win or lose Georgia and Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn is joining us on the show.  You don't want to miss it.  I call them that. How do you cancel a card and lose? I charge me already.  On September 17th, 2009, 24 year old MIT Chris Richardson disappeared without a trace in the woods near Malibu, California.  She had been arrested at a beachside restaurant for failing to pay a tab and taken to the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. You know, I mean, she's not from that area. And I would hate to wake up to a morning report. Well, lost somewhere to a job. The police released her just after midnight with no car, no cell phone, no money. She doesn't know the area. She's never been in your area. Well, I think she said, Chris, that what happened is that's way more than just her, OK?  My trees disappeared into the darkness and was never seen alive again. I'm Catherine Townsend, host of the podcast Houngan, we're going to try to find out what really happened to my Chris Richardson School of Humans and I heart radio present. Helen, season three. Listen to and gone on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Congresswoman Lucy McBath of Georgia.  We talked about her state's importance in this election and how losing her son to gun violence motivated her to become the lawmaker that she is today.  Congresswoman McBath, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Well, thank you. I'm so excited to be with you. And I have to be honest with you. My youngest sister is your biggest fan. And my family's always said, where are you going to be on this show? Once you're on a show, you've really made it.  So now we're validating me. Wow. I like how they've got shifted priorities because in my world, becoming a congresswoman and living the life that you have lived and how you got that many people know your story, but for those who don't. You started your story from a place that I feel many people should start in politics, and that is a personal place. You were a flight attendant for most of your life. You lost your son to gun violence and you didn't just mourn his passing.  You decided to step up and do something about it. And so you ran to change not just his world, but the world and how America sees guns. So in my world, you have made it and we're going to talk about all of that today. So thank you so much for joining us on the show. Let's start first talking about Georgia, because that's what's really in the news right now. Georgia has become what many people thought would never be a battleground states.  When you look at what has happened in Georgia, do you think that this is Georgia changing or do you think that this is Georgia responding to Donald Trump? Georgia is changing, Trevor, as I've been saying for years now, that this is the new South and I think the resistance that we've seen is just that the resistance to the New South and just the amazing movement building that's been done, the strategizing that's been done, the grassroots organizing that's been done.  I knew we were going to be a top tier battleground state. And so I've been telling people all along, please invest in Georgia. The best is yet to come. And we've we've shown that, you know, we made President Trump a one term president and we've actually been able to be a deciding state for president elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. So, yes, the South is changing. And I'm glad that this Peach State has the ability to be on the front lines of that.  Reading your memoir. I mean, it's inspiring and it's heartbreaking at the same time, because you read this tale of a woman who goes through the gripping experience of losing her son. Your son was shot by a man who felt like his friend was playing the music too loud in the car. That was it. And then try to use Stand Your Ground laws to defend what he had done and taking his life. You then use this and that's become part of the title of your book is Standing Our Ground.  What do you think it is about the coalition of mothers that you formed around the country that has moved the idea of gun advocacy forward? Well, as mothers, as women, we're the central focus of our homes, oftentimes we're the protectors where we're often providers, and we want to make sure that when we send our family out the door, when we send our children out the door, that they come home safely, we do everything that we can.  And so building this grassroots coalition of mothers and also survivors is really indicative of what we need to do, what we'll have to do to make sure that we are providing safe spaces for our children and our families in our own communities. And that's what we've been doing. And over 90 believe in gun safety legislation, common sense legislation that really will provide safety nets for our families, and also making sure that a law abiding gun owners are using their guns in a way that is providing a safety net as well.  When they're using those guns, a lot of people in your position would have become a single issue candidates. A lot of people in your position would have gone. All I'm here to talk about is guns. But you're actually looking to to improve health care, to improve gun reform, to improve veterans health care, you know, and then the support that veterans get. And you've really been fighting for a lot of these issues, which surprisingly, as a Democrats, you've gotten signed by Donald Trump not once, not twice, but three times.  So the question then is. How have you managed to work laws or create ideas that have gotten a signoff from Republicans who have shown the ability to block so many different ideas?  I've always reached across the aisle to find some common ground with my Republican colleagues that we could work upon, because when we don't work together and we we end up in the mess that we've been in it in for so long now because we've not been working together for the sake of our constituents that are really depending on us in Washington every single day to create value for them. Our constituents all have the same power to provide the best of what America says they deserve.  Representative Jim Clyburn said something interesting, and this was after the results started coming in and it was apparent that Joe Biden had won. But down ballot Democrats seem to have taken a beating and he said there was no denying that defund the police and abolish the police and socialism hurt the Democrats message.  As somebody who is elected in a state that is really moderate and very close, how do you communicate some of these ideas? Like is there is there a different way that you communicate progressive ideas without isolating Republican or moderate voters?  I wish, of course, we'd been able to pick up more seats for the House, but we have to find what works within your own community. That's what I have said to my colleagues all the time. Is that what I say or what I represent to my community might be completely different from another community, another from another one of my colleagues. I would love for us to be able to hold on to some of the states, some of my colleagues that came in with me, my freshman colleagues.  I was very pained by the fact that they won't be returning with us. But there again, I think that each of us has been able to just really speak very candidly to our own constituents. All of our demographics are different. But as I said, you know, there are a lot of different voices in this caucus and that that's what makes us so unique.  I'll be honest, I think that's one of the things that makes you unique, is that not only are you a symbol of that, but you articulated so well to everybody who takes the time to listen. Thank you so much for coming on the show. And thank you to your family who think that I am the thing that means you've made it. I don't agree, but I appreciate that. So thank you so much to your youngest sister, because between me and her, she's right.  She's not right, but she's very right. So thank you very much.  Thank you, Chairman. I just want to say this. Thank you so much for having such a deep conversation with me, because it reminds me of the conversations I used to have at the kitchen table with Jordan. So thank you for that.  Thank you very much. Thank you. That means the world to me. Take care.  Don't forget Congresswoman Macbeth's memoir, Standing Our Ground. Another story is now available in paperback.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn. We talked about her life off the slopes, the new reality show that she's cohosting with her dog and so much more.  Lindsey Vonn, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you. Good to be here. Before we get into all the things that you are doing, I wonder if you are ever happy that you retired when you did. Because I feel like you retired and then the whole world had to retire because of coronavirus. I remember when you were retiring, I was like, oh, Lindsey, what are you going to do now? You're just going to sit at home and eat like chips and do nothing to enjoy your life.  Loser. And now we are all losers with you. Are you happy now?  Yeah. You know, I think it was pretty good timing. I'm not going to lie. I'm not jealous of everyone that's trying to travel the world right now.  Let's talk a little bit about what Lindsey Vonn has been doing since then. You have an exciting new show called The Pack, and you shot this before the virus shutdowns. Is there any fun show where you are competing like people competing against each other? But the teammate is the dog.  I mean, it's way better than having a teammate as a human being. I think it's a lot more exciting. But yeah, this is my lovely co-host, Lucy, my dog. It was a really fun show to do, actually. And we were right, right, right. Before covid happened, you were kind of escaping every city before it kind of got shut down now.  Yes, it was a little bit intense, but luckily we made it through. We got the whole series done. And on Friday, you guys will see the finished product."}]}

Nissan believes you deserve a car that thrills you. So we have to ask, does your car thrill you when you hit the pedal? Do you get something back? A chill in your spine, goose bumps on your goose bumps when you take off to your fingers tightened around the steering wheel. Does your heart beat in your stomach in your breath, catch your chest. Just driving, make you feel alive because it should.  And if your car doesn't thrill you, ours will. This is the new Nissan.  One of the main questions many people may have, and you see this unfortunately all too often, is people saying, why do you have to keep trudging this up? Can't we just move on? It's been four hundred years now. Can't we just move on? What do you hope would be sparked by the conversations that come from a magazine that delves into slavery like this? What do you what do you want? Someone who sits at home and says they're going to call.  I'm I'm white and I have nothing to do with this. And I don't know what you want me to do. What would you hope people take away?  That's a great question. Let me just say for the record, nobody wants to get over slavery more than black folks.  It's not to our benefit, right? The fact that our nation can't get over slavery is not benefiting black people for a single day, but that's the problem. We've never dealt with the harm that was done. I'm forty three years old and my father was born into a Mississippi where black people couldn't vote, black people couldn't use public facilities. That was all perfectly legal. We're not far removed from this past at all and there's never been any effort to redress that harm.  So what I hope that people will take from the magazine, every single story in the magazine starts with America today and shows how these things about American life that you think are unrelated to slavery actually are. And I hope by confronting that truth, maybe we can finally start to repair the harm that was done and then finally start to live up to be the country of our ideals. There's been so much talk about history and heritage, people talking about monuments in America, people talking about the history of America, but in many ways, Brian, you would argue that the history people wish to America is not we should remember all of America is not really the full story.  What is your project about?  Well, it's about confronting the fact that we're not really free in America. I think we're burdened by a history of racial inequality that we have not addressed. And it's become like smog in the air. And we all breathe it in. And it doesn't take much to expose these conflicts and tensions. And so we're trying to change that. We want to talk about some things that haven't been talked about. I think we need to talk about the fact that we're a post genocide society.  Before white settlers came to this continent, there were millions of native people who were slaughtered through famine and war and disease. But we didn't call it a genocide. We said those people are savages. And we created this narrative of racial difference, this ideology of white supremacy. And that's what ushered in centuries of enslavement. And for me, the great evil of American slavery wasn't involuntary servitude. It wasn't forced labor. It was this ideology of white supremacy, this idea that black people aren't like white people.  And we never really addressed that. If you read the 13th Amendment, it talks about dealing with involuntary servitude and forced labor, but it doesn't talk about ending this ideology of white supremacy. And because of that, I don't think slavery ended in eighteen sixty five. I think it evolved and it turned into decades of terrorism and violence. And we don't understand that history. And that's why we started this project between the end of the Civil War and World War Two, thousands of African-Americans were pulled out of their homes.  They were burned alive. They were hanged. They were brutalized. We're not interested in talking about this history because we want to punish America. I think we want to liberate America. We're going to get us to the place where we can actually look at one another without this narrative of racial difference, this ideology of white supremacy, limiting who we are and what we can be.  In many ways, you argue that Obama's presidency and black leadership in any way, shape or form is in some way contributing to white supremacy, which is a very complicated argument. What do you mean when you say that? I wouldn't quite fit. I would say it's not, you know, like I don't think Obama did anything but be a human being and, you know, go into the office and just happen to be somebody check black on the census form.  It's the reaction to that, right? It's always the reaction to the ordinariness to the bourgeois. And so the middle class ness of normal everyday black people and how well that accords with what this country claims of value. That's always a threat because it automatically undermines the suppositions of white supremacy, which says that black people don't take care at kids, black people, you know, you know, always killing each other and then up and down like there's a kind of moral judgment that can always be made on black people.  This goes back to, you know, justifications to slavery and black folks who present themselves in a particular way as undermining that. You know, it's always a threat to the thinking about white supremacy. I think that's why folks were so offended by Obama. And I think that contributed to the birth of racism. You know, all the sort of weird conspiracy theories that sprung up around the.  The KKK grand wizard emeritus David Duke, he told his followers to vote for Donald Trump and Donald Trump was coy about disavowing Duke's support. Right. So, by the way, this this is David Duke over here.  Let's go here. Yeah, this is him sporting his casual look. See, that was just like no hood. Please, please. Mr. Wizard was my father. My friends call me grand.  Now, obviously, a grand wizard of the KKK praising the Republican front runner is going to stir up a lot of emotion. And we saw that on CNN as a Trump supporter and a Democrat faced off as the Super Tuesday results were coming in.  Racial tensions front and center in this year's race. Two of our commentators get into a fiery debate on the issue of commentators. Jeffrey Lord and Van Jones got into this heated debate over Donald Trump and the KKK. When he is playing funny with the Klan, that is not cool. This is what liberals do. You were dividing people by race, by clan, dividing half of you, half the divide by race, kill people by race. And you have the opportunity.  And they did it. They did it to further the progressive agenda.  Why were you so afraid of what he was saying and why? Why are you so afraid of the rhetoric that's being that's being perpetuated?  Well, I think that America needs to wake the hell up, wake the hell up.  This is real. This is a real thing.  I think you have people everybody says, you know, the Republicans or the establishment, like, why didn't they take Trump more seriously? Yeah, the whole society is making the same exact mistake.  I think we have the rise of a right wing authoritarian movement. And I think this guy is likely to become president United States if we don't quit screwing around.  White nationalists descending on Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate leader Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, where protests are turning violent.  At least one person is dead after a car plowed into a group of counter protesters. President Trump turns an infrastructure event into a rambling rant blaming both sides for the violence.  You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. I think there's blame on both sides. You look at you look at both sides. I think there's blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it. And you don't have any doubt about it.  First of all, a racist neo-Nazi killed a peacefully protesting woman with his car. Right. Then the president of the United States defended the neo-Nazis who that dude was marching with. And this is the thing. It's not once but twice. Like Donald Trump said. It's then three days later, he came back and said, hey, hey, you know how I said that Nazi defending thing? Well, I just realized that I messed up. I didn't defend them enough.  Yeah. Yeah. My support was here and I was I was trying to get it here. Yeah. And I'm not like I don't know about you, but it seemed for a moment that, OK, this was it.  This was clearly not what presidents do. You know, after tragic national events, a leader, even a mediocre leader, says the things to unite the country, to calm the tensions, not inflame them, and especially not express sympathy for Nazi sympathizers. But today in America.  We're not even at that point seven months into his term. Forty one months to go, by the way, and the president of the United States has officially legitimized white supremacist, basically saying we need to see things from the Nazis point of view, you know, march a mile in their boots.

Are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence and a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland? I'm willing to do anything. I want to do it, sir.  Do it. Say you want to call them. What do you want to call them? Give me a name.  Give me what you like me to give out bonuses and right out of my face, stand back and stand by.  But I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. Somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left, because this is not a right wing problem is.  Wow, there you have it, folks. Trump had an opportunity to be like white supremacists. I don't with you instead.  He's like, stand by, guys. I never know when I'm going to need you telling white supremacists to stand down and telling them to stand by. I'm not the same thing. That one little word makes a huge difference, like the difference between a blow out and a blowjob. Do not ask for the wrong one at Supercuts. Again to the staff at Supercuts. I apologize. I hadn't slept and I didn't read the menu properly. And even for that non condemnation, Trump had to be dragged into it like no president should ever have to be pressured this hard into condemning white supremacists.  It's the easiest thing. Trump did it so grudgingly. He was like one of those guys who refuses to make real apologies. What I'm supposed to apologize for tailgating at your dad's funeral. Fine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're unable to have a good time. Some of us are still living. And by the way, you know that you've truly botched your condemnation of a hate group when that hate group says thank you for the endorsement.  The proud boy is a far right extremist group, immediately celebrating the president's comments on social media.  They went nuts on social media celebrating. They put out those words as a rallying cry. Stand back. Stand by. Within minutes, the group's members were posting on private social media, calling Trump's comments, quote, historic. The New York Times reports that some group members labeled it as a tacit endorsement of their violent tactics, while another posted the group is already seeing a spike in new recruits.  Yes, thanks to Donald Trump's failed condemnation, this hate group is now seeing an increase in recruits, which means in the history of television, that might be one of the worst answers ever given. The problem is like Donald Trump's answer so much that they even adopting it as the new slogan. And that actually might piss off Trump because the one thing he definitely believes in is getting royalties.  Well, well, well, nobody should be advocating the supremacy of the white man without getting dunnies. I don't know at this point. People are still acting surprised when he refuses to denounce white supremacists, because as you may remember, this is not exactly a new thing for him.  I think there's blame on both sides.  And you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides today with white nationalist rising threat around the world.  I don't really there are white supremacist groups and individuals like that who support you, some of whom you've even retweeted.  Well, that I know nothing about. I mean, I don't know about retweeting. I mean, you read tweet, somebody turns out to be a white supremacist. I know nothing about these groups that have supported me.  Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?  I don't know anything about David Duke, OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I have to. Look, if you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong. But, you know, it's in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair.  So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know, OK?  I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but I don't know honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him and I just don't know anything about him.  Yeah, it's actually hard to keep track of all the times that Trump had the chance to be anti-racist and didn't."}]}

The first lady, it's not a job that's actually in the Constitution, but that's just because in 1787, women hadn't been invented yet and even the first lady is not an official role. They've been important figures in the country from the very beginning.  From the earliest days, America's first ladies were referred to as lady presidents or Republic and queen.  The term first lady didn't come into use really until Dolly Madison's time.  The fourth first lady pioneered the practice of championing social causes. She helped orphaned children and supported women's rights.  And it said that at Mrs. Madison's funeral, President Zachary Taylor eulogized her as the country's first lady, the first time that title was ever used. That's right.  Dolly Madison was the first first lady, but she didn't know it because President Taylor only called her that at her funeral.  If I would Dolly Madison, I would be dead.  But also, I would have been so pissed at Zachary Taylor because before him, people were calling her lady presidents or Republican queen, and that was so much cooler as names. Then at her funeral, some dude is like, no, she was the first lady. If I was her, I'd be getting out of that casket. Like what you say, bitch. You call me Queen, Supreme First Lady Queen. But while the idea of a first lady has been around from the beginning, the job as we know it today didn't really kick off until the 1930s.  You know, it's like how four years Netflix was a company that sent DVDs in the mail. But that's not what people think of as Netflix now. And the first streaming on demand first lady was Eleanor Roosevelt's.  Eleanor Roosevelt really innovated the first lady's role as a public communicator. She wrote thousands of columns, twenty seven books. She participated in hundreds of radio shows.  She felt that her role was to really reach out to the American people and to learn from them about what they wanted in policy.  First lady had taken to the road and traveled hundreds of thousands of miles, going right to the source of the country's pain during the Depression, meeting miners in Appalachia. Challenging Southern Democrats to support anti lynching legislation and during World War Two, visiting internment camps where Japanese Americans were imprisoned simply because of their race.  The first lady was often alone at the wheel, driving herself cross country.  Now, that is ballsiest as hell. Eleanor Roosevelt was so politically active, she visited the Japanese internment camps that her husband set up. It's so classic for a wife to go around cleaning up her husband's mess. She was probably at those internment camps like, I'm sorry, he just gets a little racist. Sometimes work has been really stressful. He's not normally this way. Really, really isn't. And she even took road trips by herself, which was very gutsy.  In the nineteen thirties, there was no phones, no GPS, you know, although I guess it's hard to get lost when they were only like what, two roads in the entire country.  OK, listen up. If you want to get from California to the White House, pay attention. You want to turn on the road. Are you listening. You want to turn onto the road one and then you're going to drive straight down road one and then you'll be there.  And once Eleanor Roosevelt realized that she could use her position to bring attention to the issues that were important to her, every first lady who followed did the same.  Lady Bird Johnson sought to beautify the nation and took an active role in the Head Start program for early child development.  Barbara Bush advocated for literacy, as did Laura Bush in 1960 to Jackie Kennedy Onassis created the White House Historical Association.  Betty Ford was vocal about women's issues. She supported the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal, and she supported the Equal Rights Amendment. She openly discussed her breast cancer and mastectomy.  When Michelle Obama was first lady, one of her key initiatives was to push for healthier nutrition and food choices that translated into a change for public school lunches around the country.  In the 80s, Nancy Reagan appeared in a popular sitcom to boost her just say no campaign about Mrs. Reagan.  I'm concerned about drug abuse, especially among the young.  Wow, that is commitment. Nancy Reagan was so determined to stop drug abuse, she even went on a sitcom to speak out on it, which would be impossible to do today. I mean, TV shows are so much more adult now. I mean, it's easy to tell Gary Coleman not to do drugs. It's a lot harder to try and do that on your forehead. Just say no, Zendaya bitch. You should have been here season one. But it's through that activism that first ladies get to show who they really are and how they want the world to change.  You know, Michelle Obama cared about health. Hillary Clinton cared about children and education. Melania cared about stopping cyberbullies and say what you want, but her agenda got done. And the thing about being a first lady is that they're not just expected to promote social causes. They're also expected to be style influences, Jackie Kennedy's pillbox hats, Nancy Reagan's red dresses, Hillary Clinton's pantsuits or Nixon's Zenna cosplay.  But of course, all this attention also means that first ladies get subjected to intense scrutiny by the press. And it's not something that they've been happy about.  To be the first lady may be the most difficult job in Washington. Martha Washington famously said the role of first lady can sometimes feel like a state prisoner.  Michelle Obama wore a pair of shorts, just a regular pair of mom shorts, and an uproar ensued. Days of video commentary and pictures and debate about whether it's OK for a first lady to wear shorts.  Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel, was blasted in the papers for being a pipe smoking hillbilly from Tennessee.  Jackie Kennedy called the press harpies, and she hated the constant attention.  This he felt very uncomfortable, very ill, at ease with all the fanfare and the attention of the press.  There was a famous incident where she was doing a christening of a ship and she went to break the bottle and they forgot to score the bottle ahead of time. So she's banging it and banging and it just won't break it. She was humiliated.  She told her husband, I'm not doing another public appearance. Oh, poor Bess Truman. I honestly feel bad for her because we've all had that moments where we just can't open a jar of peanut butter. But imagine if the entire country was watching you struggle with that jaw. Almost got everybody.  Hold on. Try running hot water over it. I tried that already, if you ask me, the person to blame is the one who started this whole tradition, who thought it was a good idea to christen a new ship by smashing it with a champagne bottle. You don't christen a new car by slashing the tires with a samurai sword. And honestly, all the first ladies are in an unfair situation because none of them asked to be in that position.  Martha Washington was right. It is sort of like a prison, although it's weird to say you feel like a prisoner when you own slaves yourself.  Sometimes I just feel like I can't leave. You know what I mean? Yeah, Mrs. Macer, I think I do. But maybe the most fascinating thing about First Ladies is that even though no one votes for them and they kind of make up the job as they go, just by virtue of being married to the president, they can end up having a lot more power than many elected officials.  The first lady is the most powerful woman in the country because she has the ear of first thing in the morning and last thing at night of the most powerful man in the country, going back to the very first first lady, Martha Washington, and the second one, Abigail Adams.  Both of them were politically involved. They were involved in cabinet decisions. They were involved in campaigning. These women were political partners.  Nancy Reagan was pulling a lot of the strings, calling many of the shots from President Ronald Reagan's first campaign for the White House back in 1980 to his Cold War ending triumph in nineteen eighty seven.  Hillary Clinton became more involved, obviously, in policy making than any first lady before her. She had an office in the West Wing. Bill Clinton even ran on the slogan Buy one, get one free.  In 1919, Edith Wilson was unofficially running the country after her husband, Woodrow, suffered a stroke.  That's insane, man. Not only have first ladies influenced the president, Edith Wilson ended up running the government. And by the way, that totally screwed the vice president over. I mean, like 90 percent of the vice president's job is being the case. The president goes down. So that's like being Tom Brady's backup and then he gets hurt. But then Jazelle comes out like, no, no, no, I got this. Get back on the bench, loser I throw for my husband.  So as the Biden administration gets underway, history suggests that Jill Biden will likely be a major part of it because first ladies always have been.  And if you don't know now you know.  When you were a little kid, you probably believed that people vote for presidents and whoever gets the most votes wins.  Yeah, simple child mind the same way you believe that your younger brother was brought by the stork. But once you got older, you learned that actually your mom and dad were riding the F train to Bowen town because Bowen town is where the stock lives and that's how they got your little brother. And in the same way, the system for electing a president in America is more complex than just one person, one vote.  Because, you see, America's founding fathers wanted to come up with something that would prevent their biggest fear, the people choosing someone terrible.  The Electoral College is a sort of glued together solution to the constitutional convention, really.  So they said, should the Congress elect the president? No. If they do that, then Congress will own the presidency.  Another option was to have the people select their leader. But at the time, they thought the country was too large and the people not informed enough to make that choice.  And one of the odd compromises that they came up with was actually using this set of political elites to do the actual voting for president, but still providing a mechanism to select those those electors.  They thought by creating this wise group of elites, these electors could filter popular passions. They were afraid of a demagogue being chosen. They mistrusted direct democracy.  Alexander Hamilton wrote that the goal was to ensure that, quote, The office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. That's right.  According to Alexander Hamilton, the office of the president will never fall to the left of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed. Damn, I should make a musical out of this. You guys do this. But the point is Americans don't vote for the presidents. Americans votes for a slate of electors who will then go on to vote for the president. In many ways, it's the same way that American high school kids don't buy the beer.  They give the homeless men money and then he goes to buy the beer on their behalf. That way it's more responsible. And it's amazing how if you read into it's the founding fathers really thought that everyone in the country was Super Dome because everyone talks about how they wanted to build a new perfect society when really they were just basically installing childproofing to keep the country safe and stop Americans from eating sand. Now, this whole idea of electors being smarter than the masses fell by the wayside pretty quickly.  And one of the main reasons for doing this was because they thought a lot of Americans wouldn't know enough about the candidates to vote for them. But you see, that was hundreds of years ago when information was harder to come by. Like you only found out news when someone delivered it by horse. But now we've got the Internet people with everyone super informed, like everyone in America. We all know things. Look at my phone like I know that Hunter Biden moved to Russia and sold his laptop to Rudy Giuliani for drugs.  I know that Hillary Clinton is in a pedophile ring and they drink the blood of children. And I know that Melania has a body double who's having an affair with Gary Busey.  Actually, you know, maybe we should go back to the horse. I don't know about this Internet thing, but the point is today it's understood that a state's electors will vote for the candidate who won their state's popular votes.  The only problem is that's just an understanding. It's not an actual law.  According to the National Archives, there is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote according to their results of the popular vote in their state.  Those who don't follow the wish, the will of the electorate, they're called faithless electors. In twenty sixteen, four of the 12 electors in Washington decided not to vote for Hillary Clinton, despite Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote in that state. Instead, three voted for Colin Powell and one voted for the Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle.  It isn't a new concept. According to a fair vote, there have been one hundred and sixty seven faithless electors since the Electoral College was founded. Forty three percent change their vote because the candidate they were supposed to vote for died before the Electoral College could vote 40 percent who chose to vote for the candidate they wanted rather than matching the popular vote, 17 percent either didn't vote or cast an abnormal vote in the 2004 election.  Rather than casting their vote for John Kerry, the unknown elector cast their vote for Kerry's VP, John Edwards, and also misspelled Edwards name as Edwards. Wow.  So the founders just let elect us, do whatever they want. They can choose someone the people didn't vote for. They can vote for a third party. They can even just vote for a typo. I can't believe what a giant flaw in the American electoral system. This is like finding out that they keep a key to Fort Knox under the doormat."}]}

The ongoing pandemic. I invested all my money into Quebec, but then came the big election.  And just when it started to seem hopeful, people started calling the election a fraud.  I wasn't surprised that there was election fraud because it isn't the first time it's happened.  I couldn't believe it as a 20, 20 wasn't bad enough. It's shameful. This election rigging has threatened to derail avium democracy.  That's right. Avian democracy is in peril. New Zealand's Bird of the Year competition has been rocked with revelations of a slew of fraudulent votes streamed in overnight for the little spotted Kiwi, which pushed it into an unexpected and false lead.  I expect this type of behavior from America, but not from beautiful, perfect covid free New Zealand. As a fellow bird enthusiast, I felt that not only were they shitting on democracy, but more importantly, they were tearing these two majestic creatures apart.  We've been running the Bird of the Year competition for 15 years.  Laura Kuin, spokesperson for New Zealand's Bird of the Year competition.  It started out as a page in the Forest and Bird magazine, where people wrote down their favourite bird and sent it in the mail. But now it's all gone online and it's an absolute cultural phenomenon.  I love Forest and Bird, the centerfold for the Crested Finch in 98.  Let's just I'm going to we'll keep going what is the significance of this competition for people or.  Well, over the years, our chance to celebrate our amazing native species, 80 percent of our birds that are facing extinction. So it's a chance to get motivated to protect the birds that they love.  I think we should address the pigeon in the mall food court. Do you believe that there was bird fraud?  Yes, there was some irregular voting that was detected. What was it about the election that ruffled feathers? Yes.  So the votes for the little spotted kiwi just spiked all of a sudden and looked really strange.  Little spotted Kiwi. Oh, my God. That's what my ex-girlfriend used to. So who ended up winning the actual election?  The winner was the characterful. Well, the cockpit was amazing. Bonnie Hartfield, campaign manager, team cockapoo.  It's this massive green bird. So it doesn't fly. And all they do is sleep all day and eat food and just hang out. They are also very horny birds. They will try and screw anything.  Flightless, sleeps all day fat and horny. Sounds like Meader and Cornton.  Congratulations, you beautiful bird. But the question remains, who sent in all the illegal votes so the cockroach wouldn't win?  The Kakapo doesn't deserve to win. Emma Rossin, number one suspect and campaign manager for Kiwi PUCA. Lukaku Close Keamy Pucallpa.  Who can we could do can you do it slower, please? Kiwi cuckoo, cuckoo puca. Lukaku Cuckoo, cuckoo.  OK, obviously this is just an accent thing, so let's just get into it. Why did you do it? Kelly and Kiwi.  Look, I didn't get a little spotted. Kiwi embodies the values of truth, democracy, freedom, equality, fairness. Voter fraud is not the Kiwi way.  According to who? Me, you can't argue with that. So who was behind this? I needed to speak with someone on the inside.  I needed my very own Deep Throat, but I love even Richard Data scientist, voting analyst and lover of birds. Walk me through the day.  You realized there was an injustice happening inside at this prestigious bird competition.  What are some of the numbers on individual votes for each one, for each birds? And it comes with the email address and the IP address all along, looking at how the voting in most of the time you've got one vote closes all the bases and no one else when you're not coming from one of them was all voted for a Democrat across the board.  How did you contact Forest Bird?  You just pick up that red telephone on your desk that triggers the alarm because strict their headquarters say yes, just an e-mail before they got on board. Democracy is restored.  That's it. You just noticed a bunch of emails from one IP address and you deleted them.  It's boring.  Still, it's a relief to find a case of voter fraud with actual evidence. Now the only thing left to decide the punishment, Laura, what fate lies for these criminals?  Do you take birdseed and spread it on their genitals and let the birds loose? You know?  Well, we just we just urge people to to play by the rules to make sure that we have a fair an election. And, you know, if they try to cheat the issue, we will find them and will be very disappointed.  Disappointed. And then then you put the birdseed on the genitals and you let the birds loose like Hitchcock style.  Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. So in the end, bird democracy triumphed. The Kiwis fraud was uncovered. The Galapagos took its rightful office and US avian fans can get back to the bird watching we love so much. Thank you so much for that, Michael.

She's a former US government studies teacher who runs the popular Instagram account. Sharon says, So we talked about her approach to government and politics, fighting misinformation and how she's using her platform to give back.  Sharon McMahon, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you. You have one of the most interesting Instagram accounts out there because it's not popular because of the destinations that are being listed as not popular because of thirst traps. It's not popular because of Meems.  It is popular because you give people facts. That seems ludicrous. And maybe five years ago, someone would have said, why would anyone have an Instagram account where all they're doing is sharing facts? But that is what you do. And the last time I checked, you have something over half a million subscribers and that number keeps jumping up and jumping up and jumping up. Let's start at the beginning. Why on earth would you start a fact based Instagram account?  Well, it's not my incredible sweater collection that is interesting to people. You know, I have been a high school teacher for a long time and I started noticing an incredible amount cover. Maybe you've noticed this, an incredible amount of misinformation circulating on the Internet. And it was one of those things where I just was like, I would my face must get closer to the screen. And I was like, what is even happening?  Where does this come from? So I just started making some little videos about facts. And apparently facts are missing and facts are popular right now.  What do you think it is about these videos that engages with people so much? I mean, surely people can just get facts out there. Why do you think that they were attracted to your videos and what keeps them engaged?  I honestly don't think people believe they can get facts. That is really the crux of the matter is they don't understand where to get facts. They don't know who to trust. They feel like they're getting played every day. And it's like a game of Survivor. Like, I don't know what the person's motivation is. You know, if they're trying to swindle me, you know what I mean? Like, there is just they're afraid of getting played. And I think when they maybe saw that I am not a politician, I don't work for some big company, I literally am just a teacher that has just resonated with some people.  It's resonated with them. But I mean, it's interesting that you haven't been dragged into anything because, you know, facts, whether we like to admit it or not, can become a contentious conversation starter these days. You know, like some of the first videos of yours that I saw, which were really impressive, that people loved were the ones who were about Kuhnen. And I mean, you were stepping into the fray with Kuhnen debunking Kulen myths, and you had people on your page saying, hey, I believed in Kuhnen and then I watch these videos.  Now, I don't believe in Kuhnen. But now my question to you is, how do you do that without getting dragged into the fray? Because oftentimes being for facts means that you're against somebody at some point. Yeah.  That you know, that is a question I ask myself every day. You know, like I almost feel like Webb is the other shoe to drop sometimes. Like Webb is. When are the throngs going to come? For me that is I have for sure.  I think part of it is just that I really work hard to stay respectful. I really work hard to stay respectful, to not make fun of people, to honor the fact that there are a variety of viewpoints and that I'm not here to try to convince you my one perfect viewpoint. Right. That's really that's the only answer I have. I honestly don't. I don't I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop in some ways.  So when when you're doing the work. You're digging and getting the information and you're putting together the fact you had to do the same thing for Kuhnen, you have to do the research. How do you not get sucked into the Kuhnen conspiracy that you've debunked? Because, I mean, some of them are really convincing. Clearly, people get sucked in. So how do you not get sucked into the things that are nonfactual?  Yeah, that the current research is that is some of the most interesting and also disturbing things I have. I can imagine. Yeah. Yes. It's like information you don't even really want to know. No, I don't even know if I want to know this. So the way I don't get sucked into it is that I have all of this education and experience about what the Constitution actually says. And I've been teaching the Constitution and government for so many years that and I've read the Constitution so many times.  I know what's in it and what's not. And it's very easy for me to see. Like, actually, there is no second constitution. Actually, that's not real. The United States is not a corporation that was sold to London in the eighteen hundreds. You it's just very easy for me to tease out what is real and what's not. And right.  Because of my my education and experience on this topic, it feels like we live in an age now where there is a there's a birth of information. I mean, it's everywhere. But figuring out how to sift through the information is something that we like. And that is what I've always thought teachers do, is they bring you into this room where they help you sift through information as you are growing up through life as a teacher.  What do you think some of the challenges have been in teaching people things? Because people come in with preconceived notions of everything and then you have to teach them, which means you have to teach them?  Yes, this is the average American today. My experience has been that they have a very difficult time distinguishing between a lie and bias. They believe that those two things are the same. They perceive let's say they watch one of your videos forever, where you are going after Tucker Carlson, just for example. They that's obviously a biased point of view and that is a point of view that you are more than free to hold their free to hold a different point of view.  Right. Right.  But but at the core of, say, a video you may have made on that are actual clips of things he has said, actual facts about where he's gone to school. So you have a bias lens about the facts and so does every human.  This is not a dig on you in any way.  We all have our own bias that we are looking through at a variety of topics. People don't realize that they see a video like yours if they are conservative and they think, well, he's just a liar, they don't understand that there's a difference between a bias and a lie. Unable to engage with biased information that doesn't align with their viewpoint. Huh?  Makes sense. So that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Look at a CNN article and it's about, let's say, Trump's tax returns. They see that, well, they just hate Trump. They are just out to get him and they immediately discount the information when the information is based on a factual Supreme Court ruling. Right, right. Right. That's what I'm finding, is that I need to spend a lot of time educating on the difference between bias and why it feels like this is a great time to have you.  And I think that's why you're being so successful. I mean, everything from Ted Cruz's trip to what's happening in Texas all the way through to, as you say, the Constitution and Kuhnen, you tackle a range of subjects and you and you presented in a form that's easy to digest and people really enjoy. My question then to you is, where do you get your facts?  My goal every day is to read five to ten news sources from across the spectrum. So I am reading everything from the far right news to the more extreme liberal news when a story is of interest. Let's say the most recent thing about Ted Cruz going to Mexico make a point of looking for that specific story from a variety of viewpoints always falling back to primary sources like the journalism, one or one. I'm not a journalist, but that's if you can find it in the Constitution.  If you can find it in the actual text of the law, you can find the actual documents. Yes, I went back to those is always key as much as I'm as much as possible.  Before I let you go, you've also used your platform to help people in need. And you've been big in getting group philanthropy going and getting a lot of your your your viewers or your followers to to to join in and help them with the efforts. Most recently, you went after medical debt, something that a lot of people are struggling through right now, especially because of covid talk me through that and what you've been doing and what you've been able to achieve.  I decided to partner with an organization called RHP Medical Debt, which is a five one C three organization. And what they do is they buy. Medical debt, and they forgive it, and because they buy huge chunks of medical debt at a time, they're able to get massive discounts on it. So in five days, my community raised over five hundred and sixty thousand dollars worth of organization, which will forgive fifty six million dollars of medical debt. Wow.  That I mean, that is the definition of social media being used for good, right? Crowd sourcing help for people who need it. You're doing an amazing job.  I can see why you're so popular. And hopefully it goes from five hundred thousand followers to a million to two million and so on. Because in a world with facts, maybe we can get to a place where we agree on reality and then we just get to fight about what we think about that reality."}]}

Now, the following message comes from the real world homecoming, New York now streaming exclusively on Paramount. Plus, this is the true story of the real world coming back almost 30 years later. The original seven roommates that started the reality genre are moving back in together for the new multi episode docu series, The Real World Homecoming. New York joined Becky, Heather, Erik, Kevin, Andre, Julie and Norman and find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real all over again.  The Real World Homecoming, New York, a new multi episode docu series now streaming exclusively on Paramount Plus. Let's start with the simplest explanation of the filibuster. It's basically a loophole in the Senate rules for blocking legislation, because even though you only need 51 votes to pass the bill, you need 60 votes to stop the debate over voting on that bill in the first place, which means as long as the minority party can keep debating, then the bill is basically dead.  And if you're wondering why on earth would the founding fathers put that in the Constitution? Well, they didn't.  The filibuster began as a historical accident. It's not some great tradition in the Senate that's protected by the Constitution. That happened in 1855 after Aaron Burr, that a rules change in Burr as vice president in the early eighteen hundreds just going over these rules of the Senate.  And he made a critical mistake. We thought we don't really need a way to stop a debate, do we?  I mean, there's just a few of us like we will debate until we're done. Everyone's had their say. How slow could the Senate really be?  Nobody knew it at the time. It'd be three more decades before the first filibuster was actually mounted. But that was the moment the Senate created the filibuster.  That's right. The filibuster isn't in the Constitution. It's just a rule that was made up by that guy who shut Lin Manuel Miranda. And it didn't even start out as a way to block legislation. It was a way for the Senate to keep debate open, not to debate for so long that nobody could ever actually vote on a bill. So its original purpose is completely different from what people decided to use it for later on. It's insane. It's sort of like how Facebook was invented as a way to see which of your classmates were hot and then years later became a way to organize a lynch mob for Mike Pence, by the way, is hot.  And you might wonder why senators back then would want to risk having an endless debate. But don't forget, guys in the eighteen hundreds, it wasn't anything better to do. I mean, it was either listen to Thadeus, talk about a bill or take a bumpy carriage ride back to your plantation where a bunch of black people wanted to discuss their terms of employment. You're probably going to want to hear what Thadeus has to say either way. Eventually, senators realized that they could block legislation by debating forever.  And that could get pretty ridiculous because there was no rule on what counted as a debate. So senators came up with all kinds of random ways to fill that time, which led to moments like this.  Louisiana Democrat Huey Long filibustered several bills in arguing against a bill. He recited recipes for salad dressing and discussed at length the best way to fry oysters. His most famous filibuster was on June 12. Nineteen thirty five, he was able to speak without stop for 15 hours and 30 minutes, running out of things to say about the bill. He offered to give advice on any subject someone requested.  Yup. In nineteen thirty five, this white dude rambled on about nothing for over 15 hours and somehow he gets zero credit for inventing the podcast. So unfair. But the Senate is crazy, man. This guy got on the floor and talked for 15 hours about oysters and salad dressing. I mean, they should make it a rule that you at least have to try to connect your speech to the bill that you're supposed to be debating.  I guarantee a salad dressing is delicious. But you know what doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth letting women wear pants. But still, I'm not going to lie.  It's impressive that he could talk for that long. That shit is hard. I can't even think of twenty seconds of stuff to talk about to a co-worker in an elevator.  So going to floor nine, huh? Yeah. How's this weather? We're having so much weather.  I think I'm just going to get out here. Good.  I will say though, it makes sense that senators are so good at filibustering because most of them are grandparents. Don't forget that. Visit your granddad and see if he doesn't take three hours to tell you a story that happened in 20 minutes. You're filibustering, grandpa, but it wasn't until the late nineteen fifties that the filibuster started to become more common. And what caused was so inspiring to senators at that time that they just had to stand up and speak for hours being racist.  For a few decades the filibuster was used, but pretty sparingly. Then at the Senate starts to consider civil rights legislation and Southern senators really hate this, but they don't have the votes to actually defeat the bills. So they start using.  The filibuster became a tool that Southern senators used to prevent the federal government from intervening in racial segregation.  Perhaps the most famous one was when South Carolina's Strom Thurmond took the floor against the nineteen fifty seven Civil Rights Act.  Thurmond notoriously read the phone book, clocking in at more than twenty four hours to try to block a nineteen fifty seven civil rights bill.  How did you last? Twenty four hours. You never left the Senate floor. I don't anticipate advance for three or four days beforehand and dried out my body in the sauna. Yes, so I wouldn't be tempted to go to bathroom. And so I was able to do that.  Oh strong.  You were too much, and when I think about all those black people who suffered because of you, you're for real men, how gross was that story?  This guy dried out his body to help him filibuster. You know, someone is committed to racism when they're willing to jerk themselves for it. And it really is amazing what humans can accomplish when confronted with their worst fears. Just as a mother will be able to lift a car off of the ground to save her child, a racist senator will suddenly be able to speak for days at a time, only to stop a black person from using his bathroom. I mean, the filibuster was used to block black people so many times.  I'm surprised they never use it at nightclubs.  Oh, a black guy. Hey, before I let you in, have I ever told you about my salad dressing? Two tablespoons of lemon juice, a pinch of rosemary. And what you want to try and do is make sure that, OK, he's got right now, eventually the Senate decided that all of these talkathons were slowing things down too much.  So in nineteen seventy five, they made what they thought was a small adjustment to the rules. Instead of having to speak, a senator could just announced that they planned to speak and unless there was 60 votes to prevent them, the filibuster would be considered successful. And that actually worked for a while until two things happened. America elected a black president and a Senate minority leader who was willing to do anything to stop him.  The practice became an art form for Republicans under Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. During the Obama years, McConnell impeded nominees and legislation left and right. He has the nickname the Grim Reaper for a reason.  Today, it's being used in a different way. It's being used to effectively kill a measure, a bill, a proposal that the minority really doesn't like.  In fact, there have been more filibusters during Obama's time in office than in the 50s, 60s and 70s combined over the entire history of the Senate before President Obama, just sixty eight judicial and executive branch nominees were blocked and required cloture, which ends a filibuster and forces an up or down vote. By contrast, 79 of President Obama's nominees required cloture from twenty nine to twenty thirteen alone.  Republicans used the filibuster against virtually every controversial bill, the nomination and some that were uncontroversial at all.  Mitch McConnell has the dubious distinction of being the only sitting senator that filibustered his own bill.  God damn Mitch McConnell loves to filibuster so much. He filibustered his own bill and he has to get four ribs removed to be able to do it. The man is sick. But yes, once Obama became president, McConnell began filibustering everything Obama wanted to appoint. A judge blocked it. Obama wants it as possible. McConnell stopped him. Obama wants you to watch something on Netflix. McConnell hid the remote in his Nick Foles.  I haven't shown it anywhere, man. Maybe you should write a book. And once McConnell decided to block Obama's entire agenda, that became the new precedent. When Democrats got the chance, they blocked President Trump's agenda just as hard to the point where now practically every piece of legislation in the Senate needs 60 votes to pass. And that's why there's a movement to get rid of the filibuster entirely, because it's not healthy for a democracy. If the loses can always block the winners from passing their agenda.  Now, the Democrats don't have the votes right now to kill the filibuster completely. But based on Joe Biden's interview, it seems like they may be willing to make it more annoying again, which won't stop filibusters from happening. But at least we'll finally get to find out what Mitch McConnell uses in his salad dressing. Sure. Walker, one of the chairs of poor people. And then you want to grind it out where the pressure. So that's the filibuster.  And if you don't know now you know.  Being president is a weird job because in a democracy, the president is the leader of the country, but they are also an employee.  So do presidents have the right to keep their health problems to themselves? Well, throughout history, presidents have answered, yes, Eisenhower was the first president to actually open up medical records.  But when a bad event happened, they went into a kind of cover up mode. September of nineteen fifty five, he was in Colorado and had a massive, I mean, massive heart attack. And instead his personal doctor told the press it was indigestion.  After Ronald Reagan was shot in nineteen eighty one, the White House released a photo showing him standing with Nancy Reagan, dropping out a nurse holding a machine connected to a chest tube and never revealing how close he came to dying.  Kennedy flatly denied his Addison's disease, a hormonal deficiency that can cause fatigue, low blood pressure and weight loss. But he had it while in office.  He at times took as many as eight medications a day just to function, including painkillers, stimulants, antibiotics, steroids, hormones.  The man was essentially a walking pharmacy. FDR was never transparent about his health, never. He tried to hide that he used a wheelchair for years and largely got away with it.  If Secret Service agents saw a photographer taking a picture of Roosevelt, say, getting out of his car, they would seize the camera and tear out the film.  Damn FDR.  People really went all out to make sure people didn't see him in a wheelchair, which kind of makes you wonder what they told people was actually going on.  Isn't it weird that we've never seen the president stand up or you should. OK, no questions. Let's move on.  I mean, look, at least back then, you could tear out someone's film in their camera in twenty twenty. The moment someone points a camera at you, you're already a meme. It's like, give me that phone.  Give me that phone. Give me that phone. Give me that. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that phone.  But yes, throughout American history, administrations did whatever it took to keep secrets about the president's health from lying about FDR, his wheelchair, by confiscating cameras to lying about Bill Clinton's asthma, by hiding his inhaler in a saxophone. In fact, hiding health conditions goes all the way back to Lincoln. I mean, why do you think he was wearing that top hat? Dude had a conjoined twin under that guy's. That's that's real. I saw that on Facebook.  In fact, the only American president who didn't get away with it was President Taft and they spilled all the tea on that guy. Poor dude got stuck in a bathtub once, and we're still talking about it one hundred years later. And then there's Grover Cleveland. Twenty second president and world's most adorable. Grover Yes. Said it. Grover Mutant Smurf. When it came to keeping secrets, President Cleveland took it to a whole new level.  It's hard to imagine an American president dropping out of sight for nearly a week, but that's exactly what happened in eighteen ninety three when Grover Cleveland underwent secret cancer surgery.  Back in eighteen ninety three, Grover Cleveland actually had a cancerous tumor in the roof of his mouth. He didn't want anybody to know, so they snuck him onto a yacht.  He had a friend who owned a yacht. So the cover story would be just going on a fishing trip. And while they were on that boat, the operation took place. Six doctors were recruited. They were all sworn to secrecy. And in about 90 minutes, they removed most of his upper left palate, five teeth and a good part of his upper left jaw as well.  They managed to keep the press at bay. They kept them at a distance from his home on Cape Cod until the wound was healed well enough.  It took about three weeks and then he was fitted with a prosthetic device that he could pop up into his upper left job. But by and large, the secret held for twenty four years.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Nobody heard from the president for three weeks.  What a dream. But God damn, that's a major cover up. Grover Cleveland basically invented that move that celebrities do when they get secret butt implants. Oh yeah. I've just been away traveling for a couple of weeks. Oh my. But yeah, I guess it did get twice as big. You know how vacations are. And if you ask me, it's hard to imagine a risky situation for a president's surgery on a boat in eighteen ninety three. And don't forget, they had Dragon's back then President Clinton was a sitting duck out there.  I saw that on Facebook. That's a real thing, right? Honestly, I don't even know why Cleveland went through all this trouble. If I were a president with a fake jaw, I would own that shit. Maybe I would use it to intimidate other foreign leaders. Oh, what's that? China. You're going to put sanctions on us. Well, check this out.  And look, maybe it's not a big problem if a president hides some dental work or a mild pill addiction. I mean, as long as they can still do the job, what's the difference?  But there was also one case of a president who got so sick that he couldn't do the job and they still didn't tell the American people Woodrow Wilson had a stroke that not even his closest advisors knew about.  His last year and a half, almost a year and a half in office, he was incapacitated.  His wife tried to conceal how bad it was. It turns out he was partially blind. He was partially paralyzed. He was lying upstairs in a bed in the White House, growing a beard.  And they pretended that it was not that that his wife and his doctor told the cabinet and told the vice president, he's OK, we got this. You just can't see him. He's in seclusion upstairs and we'll pass down his decisions.  They told the public their leader was suffering from exhaustion. Many say Edith Wilson effectively ran the country during that time.  Holy shit. You guys act like this is some fun little quirk of American history. But you all had a straight up coup and also a secret woman president's guys. That's huge.  What do people talk about this morning who run the world girls, but only behind the scenes while getting none of the credit girls? So, yes, America has a proud history of its presidents misleading the public about their health.  So from now on, when you hear Trump or his doctors withholding medical information, don't stress because in a way, this might actually be the most presidential thing Donald Trump has ever done it."}]}

His success has baffled the mainstream media, but it turns out the secret to Trump has been right under their noses the whole time.  This is a circus, unlike anything that we have seen in modern American politics is the greatest show on earth. He's the greatest show on earth.  Now, if you want to understand the circus that is Donald Trump, don't ask these idiots. Ask the guy with a sword down his throat, a circus performer, Adam, real man.  People like the danger element of a circus in a sideshow. You know, when the lion tamer sticks his head in the lion's mouth. Tell me you want a sea lion, just chop his head off.  Yeah. The audience, I think, always wants to know that this stuff is real and it is real.  We're watching a loaded gun on stage and it could go off at any moment and say Mexicans are rapists, boom. It could say anything.  So there's a dangerous Mexicans are rapists.  OK, so maybe he hasn't been to many Trump events, but real man taught me that the greatest show must have a ring leader who can work a crowd got to give Lincoln the pitch.  You have to impress them. You've got to impress your crowd. Exactly. Your poll numbers that superhigh. Correct?  I'm leading every poll nationwide. You're the best. That's it. Best businessman you've ever seen. Yes, I make great deals. Look at this show. This is the greatest show on earth. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going. Hey, let's bring out the snake charmer. We bring out the snake charmer. You bring Paillot out, OK?  You betcha. Has to be something an audience will want to see. But I had a good old time. You bought a hat. I want to see this freak again. Exactly.  This guy got it. Trump really is the greatest show on Earth, right, Adam?  Well, you know, by calling him the greatest show on Earth, you're kind of insulting a lot of the circus world.  OK, regardless, I had to see Trump up close, so I headed to one of his rallies and got to hear from some diehard trumpeter's.  I think he's the only candidate on the Republican side who's actually going to build a wall and who's going to make him pay for it. He's gonna make China and, you know, people say, oh, you can't make China pay for it. You know, as much horse crap. It's pretty easy to make China pay for it.  China will be paying for the wall for Mexico. Pay for the wall. Oh, Mexico. Sorry.  You know, it isn't one of the countries without one of those countries is paying for that. Well, Donald Trump is inaugurated. He becomes the United States. What's behind that curtain?  Take one of my definition of ISIS deficient ISIS. What should we do to ISIS?  Bomb them? Where officially should we bomb ISIS? Probably like Israel area, but not like not necessarily there, but around the area, I think is going to help with the ISIS. What's he going to do with the ISIS? He can't tell us right now. If he tells everybody, then the next thing you know, somebody else is going to copy what he says.  They knew there Trump once I was under the big top, we were all grooving to Trump's power playlist, which included tiny dancer like eight times.  Finally, there he was. And he wasted no time shining the spotlight on the main event himself. Takes guts to run for president. Believe me, no one in the polls every single week. I've been on the cover of Time magazine so much lately. When I was on last week, I didn't even know they were putting away the government. Can you imagine? That's when you're really hitting it big.  He made the audience recoil at the freak show. Looking back there, look at the press. Turn around and look at these people. Look at. They start booing, he whipped the crowd into a frenzy with a high wire act of political incorrectness. She said he's a pussy. That's go. And then something strange happened, whether just something that's going to be whether you like Dwight Eisenhower no matter what you do, Dwight Eisenhower. I like that everybody said he started to meander.  I just asked for tickets. I wanted tickets for the post office in Washington, D.C. I think people got bored. It's an incredible building.  But then, like any great showman, he pulled them back in with his greatest routine, a feat of xenophobic strain. Who the hell is going to pay for the wall? A classic bit Trump had delivered and I laughed, I cried, I reinvigorated my irrational fear of foreigners. I even jockeyed for selfies with a couple of reality TV star Donald Joe. Joe Cocker vile. Got it, a memory that will last for possibly four years. God help us all.  What was America's last great for me, I would say the turning point for our country was 1913 when we passed the 17th Amendment. And what's the like back when, like women couldn't vote? Yeah, well, back open again. Like that family. That's got your sweet spot right there. Absolutely. But 1913, what year was America? Great.  When it was founded, so for the slavery stuff, except for the slavery stuff, you know, I think we were probably our strongest immediately post-war war to go around the 1950's, mid 40s, 50s.  I mean, I think the 50s was great other than, you know, segregation and women's rights.  Look, we could we could sit here and paint negative, right. Faces of all times in America. Correct. It's make America great again. So when was the last great? It's always been great. So we're so if it's always been great, what are we trying to go back to? We're not going back. We're going forward.  Well, I guess the 80s were pretty good. All right. The 80s, 80s, great music. Crack cocaine. Crack cocaine.  Yeah, well, we're always great. The people are great. So, yeah, that's what America is great right now. So we did it. No, we didn't do it. America became became great when the founding fathers put pen and paper in 1776 and decided to build a country based on laws. That was greatness. That was awesome. Other than slavery, obviously that was trouble. And we didn't have that yet. We did have that slave and the Indian thing.  Right. That was terrible and the women's voting thing. But other than that, that was awesome. A few hiccups along the way, you know, like like they say, you know, nobody made it to the top without breaking a few pieces of China. That wasn't an insult, by the way. Donald Trump's new ideological screening test will weed out extremists with extreme views about religion, such as its oppression of women, gays and nonbelievers.  That's right. Trump wants prospective Americans to embrace religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights. At a recent rally in Wisconsin, his fans were on board. I am for extreme vetting. I am. I think it is a good idea. Extreme vetting. That's a good idea.  Of course, he forgot one thing. Just make him eat some bacon.  These guys were pumped about America's values of tolerance, so I knew they'd passed Trump's test with flying colors.  Fill in the blank for me. Two men getting married is blank. Disgusting.  Actually, the answer is legal in the United States. It's legal, but I don't like it.  It's important to believe in, you know, to have respect for everyone's religion. So you respect Christianity? I do. Judaism, yes.  Islam. No one may be president. The presidency is a man's job.  I have women are qualified to be president.  Know a female has more hormones. She could start a war in ten seconds if she has hot flashes, whatever. Boom.  Haven't all wars been started by men?  Yes. Do you think a gay couple should have the same rights as a. No, I don't. I really don't. I don't think it's fair to the gay couple.  Well, no, but the regular couple, they worked so hard, you know, and the gay couple, they want more.  Do you? When you say more, do you mean equal? Yeah, they want equal.  And that's just too much. Yeah. That's the wrong answer. Sorry, hold on. Turns out Trumps ideology test was going to be harder than I thought.  Whenever I hear president, I think of man, it's a man's job. What? I may be a close minded.  No. Yeah. Well, no.  Misogynistic.  No. You're voting against your own interests. That's it. Thank you very much.  These extreme nations, they don't they don't treat women with respect. We treat women with respect here. Yes, we do. That's an American ideal. Yeah. Tell me about your shirt.  What's it say? It says Hillary sucks, but not like Monica.  Hilarious. So we were talking about treating women with respect.  It's an American ideal that we treat women with respect. You got to give me the backlash here one more time. That's too much fun.  Trump that because we don't even see the irony in it.  I love it. Right. As passionate as these guys were, they just weren't passing Trump's ideological test. Luckily, there was still time to study. This will just help you prep for the test. So if you take it again, you'll be more welcome here. This is a DVD of the third season of Will and Grace. OK, it's a really likable and not to gay gay people. This one is going to be good for you, Gloria Steinem.  This really humanizes women because as feminists, we have so much work to be done. You know, you're a feminist. No, obviously, extreme vetting was necessary to weed out extremists. But until this plan was in place where any of us safe, are you afraid the extremists are already here right now?  They could be anywhere right here. They could be, yeah.  They could be over there with that guy or this guy. Could be anybody.  Could be anybody. This past summer, Trump flag wavers spouted a lot of theories about Hillary Clinton's health. We see the coughing fits, but she's had, it seems like a number of blood clots.  What on earth could be the reason behind Hillary Clinton's bizarre behavior?  Look, it almost seems seizure risk to me.  Turns out they were sort of right. We're now learning she's been diagnosed with pneumonia. If the crackpots halfway nailed one theory, maybe their truth fingers were in deeper than mine.  I had to find out. I had to go to Trump. Rallies in the crucial swing states of Ohio and Wisconsin to discover what his supporters know that the rest of us don't. Do you think it's worse than pneumonia and the way she looks?  Yes. What do you think is going on? It could be Parkinson's. It could be M.S., it could be AIDS. What makes you think she has AIDS? Her husband used to be. So you think Bill had AIDS? Yes. So how did Bill Clinton get AIDS? Probably messing around with Magic Johnson. That's the natural conclusion. Yes, interesting, the Clintons and Magic Johnson. What else do they know?  They're saying there's like a double of her. Do you think there was a Hillary Clinton double? Yeah, I think anything's possible when it comes to doubles. Wow.  A Clinton double. Who knew? So I printed out two identical photos to see if they could see what we couldn't.  And which one's the body double for that one. Oh, what is it about this one that makes you think it's not Hillary Clinton that a little thing on her cheek is very obvious.  And this kind of scarring or whatever this is down on her throat is different.  They look a ton alike, right? This looks a little bit younger. Do you think this looks younger? Yeah, but don't you think if you just look at something for long enough and you kind of have a paranoid mind, eventually you'll find a difference maker?  I think something like that's possible, yeah.  Which would be more attractive to people. Oh, yeah.  Uncovering Hillary's doubles is one thing, but what could they tell us about our current commander in chief, Barack Obama?  As a Muslim? He's a terrorist. Nobody will ever tell me different or even know if his addresses and if you if you don't look at the birth certificate, there's almost no evidence there. Exactly.  So there's nothing Barack Obama could do to prove that he was born here if there was maybe witnesses that were attendance at his birth like his mother. Would you listen to the mother now? Now she has motivation to lie. Do you don't trust Donald Trump's birth certificate either?  Yeah, because he's been here forever. How do you know? But how do you what's your proof? Well, his parents and I know, but they're biased. I'm talking about people who could be biased. Well, like, I'm just using your logic against you. OK.  He acts like a Muslim. He talks like a Muslim. He also does the Muslim principles as far as jewelry is concerned. Jewelry. Yeah, jewelry. Certain months of the year not wearing his wedding ring.  That's that's that's a deep cut. You want me to connect your necklace to your Christianity? Why would you do that? Well, you just taught me and I didn't even know people were connecting jewelry to religion. Muslims don't wear a Jew watch.  And one of the most unbelievable discoveries yet, Barack Obama had a big part of 9/11.  Which part? Not being around, always on vacation, never in the office.  Why do you think Barack Obama wasn't in the Oval Office on 9/11? That, I don't know, like to get to the bottom of that.  Wow. Mind blown. They also had new truths about the media cover up of Trump's surging popularity.  I don't think the media really portrays all the African-Americans to support Donald Trump.  So what should we be portraying? Where are these African-Americans?  When you literally look out across the 400, 500 people here, we don't see any way, way white people. Yeah, it's like a Dave Matthews concert, except Dave Matthews actually has African-Americans in his band. Tell me when you see somebody who is not white here.  Right here. Thank you, brother. Donald Trump. I don't even know how much a loaf of bread or a dozen eggs. So you don't you're not even supporting Donald Trump? No. OK, so he didn't work.  Turns out they got one wrong, but the rest of their theories can be backed up with ironclad sources.  And what's your source?  Just Facebook or Twitter? I mean, everything. And I feel like I like facts. And you put it all together. Exactly. So outside of having no proof.  What proof do you have? I don't even have any opinion. Your opinion?  Do I have proof? No. Do I have articles? No. But your mind is made up without any information."}]}

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show, despite what the liberal media tells you, a lot of people were upset that the Trump presidency ended yesterday.  There was Trump himself, the Trump kids.  Coronavirus, probably others, but one person who surprisingly seemed happy about the end of President Trump was his wife, Melania. And why shouldn't she be?  She got a lot done in her time as first lady. And so tonight we say farewell to Melania as we look back at all her achievements.  The first lady of the United States, she's the partner of the president, hostess of the White House and back up Snuffleupagus, but while hashtag all lives matter, there's one first lady who matters more than any other. Melania Trump. Fashion icon, animal lover, colonial explorer, on January 20th, 2017, this third wife became America's first lady.  It was a moment she celebrated with great joy and instant regret. And while public life can put a strain on a relationship, it only made Melania and Donald stronger.  Since day one, they've been inseparable. If you don't count the six months she stayed in New York while she reportedly renegotiated her prenup.  But after that, it was a love story for the ages, those ages being a hot 50 and, I don't know, 97.  During their time in the White House, Melania Donald were often seen taking long romantic walks, holding hands, trying to hold hands and refusing to hold hands. Yes, you could always see the look of fiery passion whenever Melania was at her husband's side. And it's easy to see why the first lady's husband live to spoil her.  It's Melania's birthday. So happy birthday to Melania. Do you want to tell us what you got her?  Well, I better not get into that because I may get in trouble. Maybe I didn't get her so much.  There's nothing more romantic than a man of mystery.  But a first lady's job is more than just being a devoted wife. She's also in charge of turning the White House into a white home. And Melania let nothing stand in her way. Melania Trump is defending a tweet she sent out about construction on the White House tennis pavilion, which some have criticized as tone deaf amid the coronavirus outbreak.  Yes, even in the midst of a global pandemic and with less than six and a half weeks left in office, Melania had the courage to do something literally no one was asking her to do personally.  Renovate the White House tennis court, the four inch heels with the golden shovel. And while this renovation was so masterful, it made the property brothers look like the Trump brothers. Amazingly, it came just months after her previous masterpiece, the new White House Rose Garden.  The intensely private first lady is facing the glare of the spotlight yet again, criticized for her recent renovation of Jackie Kennedy famous Rose Garden in the Rose Garden, that she put some pretty dramatic changes to good for Melania, who needs roses when a virus is destroying everyone's sense of smell anyway.  Besides, if there's one thing a supermodel knows about the importance of removing unpleasant shrubbery and at no point was Melania's flair for design more apparent than during the holiday season, when every Christmas she chose a fun holiday.  Things like Ho Ho Ho movie and The Grinch Who Murdered Christmas, although never losing the spirit of the season.  Some about Christmas.  Yes, thanks to Melania, America's saying Who gives a fuck about Christmas again?  But perhaps Melania's greatest legacy as First Lady was her celebration of all God's children whose parents could prove they were citizens.  This is a picture of Melania Trump boarding Air Force One to head down in McAllen, Texas, to visit some of the children being held in detention center. She's wearing a green jacket on the back. It's written in white. I really don't care. Do you? Wow.  Only Melania could pull off a sleeveless dress and a heartless jacket. But other than that, Melania overflows with love for children.  You see, she's not just the stepmom of these four little boss babies.  She's the nation's step mom there for America every other weekend and on holidays. So when she saw the bullying epidemic that was tormenting the country, she stepped forward with a grammatically courageous initiative. Today, I'm very excited to announce Be Best, an awareness campaign dedicated to the most valuable and fragile among us, our children.  Melania told children across America to be best and be best. They beed. Just look how much this bully learns.  Bernie Sanders Crazy Bernie, greatest loser on Earth, Crazy Bernie, one of the greatest losers of all time. This guy. No, but I meant that in a nice way.  So thank you, Melania. You made America smile and we hope we made you smile. Now, there it is. Wait. False alarm. There we go. OK, whatever.  All right, don't go away, because when we come back, New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb tells me when we can expect Donald Trump to return.  Go with.

My guests tonight is Jelani Cobb, an award winning journalist and staff writer at The New Yorker. We talked about the last four years and what it's taught us and where Trump goes from here. Jelani Cobb, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you. It's good to see you. It is an interesting time to have you on the show because you are easily one of my favorite just thinkers. You know, there are people who who write and are people who think before they write. And I consider you one of those people I really appreciated, because whether it's talking about policing or police reform, whether it's talking about politics, we're talking about issues of race in America, I always find that you you tackle these ideas from a really interesting place.  And so as America begins this new journey under a new president in a new year, my first question to you would be, what do you think about America's future as it stands right now?  I think that one of the things that came out of twenty 2020, if you can point to a small number of really good things that did come out of that year was the fact that we had to think about our history because it was reoccurring right in front of us. So much of it, you know, people trying to overrun the capital that called back to certainly black people and people familiar with the history of race in this country. What happened after Reconstruction and Wilmington in 1898 with white supremacist mobs deposed the government because it was interracial and all those historical things that were kind of piled up like kindling, and then they just, you know, burst into flames.  We had to deal with it in twenty twenty. And so I think that looking forward, I'm hopeful, but I'm cautiously hopeful that we can actually start thinking about some of the problems that we have and some of the mistakes that we made previously and finding a way to navigate forward.  Do you think that there really is a way to to escape some of the mistakes that have been made in the past? And I only ask that because I struggle with America's system being a two party system, I feel like it's inevitable that you get another Trump. And the only reason I feel like it's inevitable is because if you have one or two choices, I feel like statistically it's more likely that people it's going to end up 50 50, which means one side may win again.  I don't think everyone who votes Republican likes Trump, but they may like a lot of the policies that are in the party. But then that enables another Trump to come up. What do you think America can actually learn if it maintains a two party system going forward?  Yeah, I mean, here's the interesting thing about this conversation, which is that the founders of this country never wanted parties at all. They thought the parties were going to be destructive. That would be the quickest way that the republic would end. And the two party system that we have has collapsed before its collapsed twice in American history. And, you know, some of those dynamics were present then. And so one of the things we think we have to bear in mind in order to the best hope for avoiding that kind of situation is the reminder of how fragile democracy is and also the fact that you kind of win big or go home.  Republicans took a really big bet on Donald Trump in 2016. And the lesson they could take is that a demagogic figure like him could succeed, could be elected within particular constraints against a specific kind of opponent. Or they could take the fact that they lost the Senate, they lost the House, they lost the White House. They lost international regard. Virtually all of America's allies. We've seen four hundred thousand and counting people die because of the mismanagement of a pandemic and all those things that could be warnings.  And you're right, though, we have a disturbingly high possibility that we could find ourselves in this position again.  I remember just before Donald Trump's ascendancy, the Republican Party was having a conversation in and around. We have to expand our tent. Do you think the Republican Party will gravitate towards a world of once again trying to actually appeal to more diverse voters? Or do you think that they've now seen that there was enough excitement and anguish and grievances to maintain a vote and carry on the way they've been going for the last four years?  That's the big question. And the best I can tell you is that they have been confronted by this before in nineteen sixty six, which was two years after the 64 election where Barry Goldwater was just destroyed. He lost by four hundred and thirty something Electoral College votes. Just you know, it wasn't if it was a boxing match, they would have stopped it in the third way. And so one of the report then that came out in nineteen sixty six.  That said, we have to. Expand, we have to bring different kinds of people into the party. You can't go down the road of just appealing to basically angry white people who at that point were angry about the civil rights movement. But the other part of it is that they are really getting an increasing share of a decreasing population. About 80 percent of their voters are white and white people. Every single election since nineteen ninety six have been a smaller share of the electorate.  And so the math is not on their side. And so one of the things that political scientists think is that they may make themselves into, no pun intended, a minority party in the.  You've always had your finger on the pulse of law enforcement, for instance, not just criticizing police, but rather saying, hey, here's a system that's broken. Here's how it needs to be fixed and here's why it needs to be fixed. Is there a path to a world where law enforcement becomes equitable, a world where law enforcement no longer maintains its ties to what it was meant to be from the past?  Sure. I mean, I think that that's possible, that the things that we've seen, two things in particular, George Floyd and that excruciating eight minute forty six second video that we saw last Memorial Day and the storming of the Capitol grounds and how many off duty police officers were involved in that. And for people who are just kind of. Thinking in the knee jerk fashion or kind of accepting the slogans that the police are the thin blue line that divides us from anarchy and so on.  That's shocking for anyone who's actually looked at the data around policing in the United States. It really is not the first people who ever talk to me about defunding the police. And they didn't use that language, but they expressed that idea. The first people who ever talk to me about that were cops themselves saying that they do too many things, but in all kinds of actions, that they're fundamentally not trained to handle mental health crises, which is it makes perfect sense if someone's having a mental health crisis, you call the police, right?  I wouldn't call the cops somebody who had a heart attack. A heart attack is not illegal. So they show up in situations, go downhill predictably. And when you're really talking about creating different kinds of structures and infrastructures and cities so that no one one is not the only thing that you call for every single problem of every shape, size or orientation. And so if we have a more broadly based system of how we manage our communities, that goes a long way to reducing the footprint of policing.  And in nineteen sixty eight in the County Commission report came out, they said and this is nineteen sixty eight, they said that we should think about creating different kinds of ways of providing services to communities besides just police, especially communities of color is not new. We know, we know some of this stuff."}]}

Kendi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're listening to Comedy Central now. So we're starting, we're rolling. Are we already recording, looking at your notes, so official. Hey, guys, it's Brian Baumgartner. Maybe you've heard my podcast, an oral history of the Office, where we go deep into the making of the show now. Well, you can go even deeper. That's what she said, because I am sharing my full length conversations with the cast and crew of the office. Listen to the office deep dive starting on February the 9th on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.  Hey, everybody, what's going on? I'm Trevor Noah. This is the Daily Social Distancing Show. And today is February 2nd, also known as day two of Black History Month. So let's party people bust down some of that sweet black history music.  We do what we do anyway on tonight's show.  Another reason you might not want to get on a plane, what Reddit learned from watching Wall Street and Biden. Better have my money. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's Koch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with children.  All year before we get started, today is Groundhog Day, which leads me to ask, what the hell is Groundhog Day?  People pull a rodent out of the ground and then ask the animal to predict the weather. Really, this is so unfair, because if Africans were doing shit like this and you heard that we pulled animals out of the ground, like there are villages in Africa where people wear animal skin. And if I try to explain to them that Americans use groundhogs to predict the weather, they'd be like, but why not use satellite data? But let's move on from talking animals to emailing vegetables.  It sounds too crazy to believe scientists really have taught spinach to send emails.  All right, here's how it works. Just break it down to engineers at MIT report that spinach roots can detect a compound found in explosives like landmines when the roots detect the compound, molecules in the roots release a signal. That signal is then read by an infrared camera, which sends an email alert to scientists. The purpose of the experiment is to detect explosives, but scientists believe it could be used to warn researchers of pollution. The experiment is part of a wider field of research that involves engineering electronic systems in the plants.  It is also called Plant Nano Bionics.  All right. I'm sorry, guys. This is insane. I mean, who emails anymore? Just DM me spinach. Seriously, spinach, D.M. me.  But you also know what this means. If spinach just got on e email, it means that they're not as savvy about it as everyone else. So let me be the first to say good. My dearest friend, spinach. I have a million dollars in a trust that I suddenly cannot access until the first day of lunch. If you are able to allow me to a thousand dollars, I will pay you back fifteen times over. Please, spinach. I need you.  And now we play the waiting game. Congressman, congratulations to the scientists who are working on this breakthrough. And now that they've told spinach how to send an email, maybe they can move on to the next scientific frontier. Teaching your mom how to use face time.  How do I turn the camera? Mom, I've got to go. Just ask the spinach. Moving on to the coronavirus pandemic.  It's the reason sweatpants on our business expense. Yesterday, Western Australia went into total lockdown after discovering its first coronavirus case in 10 months. You see, Australia is very different from the United States. In the US, water goes down the drain clockwise and in Australia they care about stopping coronavirus. Now, part of the reason for Australia's success is that Australians don't resist the government as much when they tell them that they should stay at home. And it's partly because these people know that covid is a serious disease.  It's also partly because it lets Australians stay away from all the other things in Australia that could kill them. Yeah, it's bad enough that the scorpions and snakes are trying to kill me, but there's a koala that's trying to give me a nasty day. Now, eventually, of course, the world will reemerge from the pandemic.  And I know everyone thinks that they're going to jump right back into their old lives, you know, like going to bars or theatres or using the bottom half of your face to express emotion. But you might want to prepare for a period of adjustment because some things apparently take a little time to relearn.  A new report says some. Pilots are getting rusty on the job due to the pandemic because, well, there are fewer planes to fly. Some pilots grounded for months by the pandemic have seen their skills and proficiency suffer. For instance, one pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake, damaging a tow truck that was trying to pull that plane from the gate. In another case, the pilot forgot to turn on the empty icing mechanism. Other reports include lining up the wrong runway for landing.  To counter such rustiness, the FAA stops pilots from flying a commercial jet unless they have performed at least three takeoffs and three landings, either on a plane or in a simulator in the previous 90 days.  I don't know about you, but this is kind of scary. Apparently, you never forget how to ride a bike, but you forget how to fly a plane after like five days.  Oh, man, this is going to change everything. Next time the plane hits turbulence, the pilot's going to jump on the intercom like, are there any hijackers on board?  We need someone who knows how to fly the plane. Harpreet, any hijackers, please make yourself known to the cabin crew.  And listen, I get that pilots are human and everyone makes mistakes at their jobs, but there are certain jobs where there is way less room for error. You know, like as a mail carrier, you might say, oh, whoops, this package was supposed to go to apartment two and accidentally sent it to apartment three. But as a pilot, it's more like a Poopsie. These people were supposed to go to Miami and I accidentally sent them to heaven.  And trust me, now, this is not just going to be pilots, people. Everyone is going to be rushing off to covid projectionists are going to be showing movies upside down. Bouncers are going to be letting in groups of ugly dudes and telling beautiful women they got on the wrong shoes. Bullies are going to give you their lunch money. Meanwhile, until the pandemic is actually over, Americans are going to need more help getting through it. And the big question of what that help will look like is dominating Washington, D.C. right now.  President Biden's pledge of bipartisanship facing its first test tonight. The president inviting 10 Republican senators to the Oval Office to pitch their covid relief counteroffer. Their six hundred billion dollar proposal is a mere fraction of the president's one point nine trillion dollar package. The GOP plan leaves out a minimum wage boost. The president includes and whittles down his fourteen hundred dollar direct payments to Americans to one thousand dollars.  Still, when all was said and done, the White House did not appear to be conceding much ground, saying the president will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.  This is a sign of this effort from President Biden to get bipartisanship here. But it also comes as Democrats on Capitol Hill are paving the way to move forward with only Democratic votes for this relief package.  Look, man, I'm not going to lie. I get why Democrats and Republicans are having trouble agreeing on this relief package. I mean, this is a difference of one point three trillion dollars. How do you compromise when you're that far apart? It's like deciding what you want to get for dinner and you want something nice, but your date wants to eat out of a gas station, trash can. You can't compromise and eat out of a nice trash can.  But I also do love how Republicans suddenly get stingy the second that a Democrat comes into office, because don't forget, during the Trump years, they were handing out tax cuts with a strip of money gun. But now that Biden is president, suddenly they're trying to hand out covid relief a penny at a time, one penny to OpenEdge. Am I making it rain yet? Three pennies? Yes. More of a drizzle. I agree. Now, a lot of people are upset about the Democrats plan to give people fourteen hundred dollars because they say that the Democrats promised to give people two thousand dollars.  But the Democrats are arguing that everybody already got the first six hundred a month ago. And I get the Democrats point on this one. But at the same time, so many people are struggling right now. Why not just give them twenty six hundred instead? I mean, you can find the money somewhere to take it from space. What? Trump is gone. We don't have to pretend that that's the thing anymore. And finally, let's move on to the second most talked about Instagram video from last night's Ofter Courtside Karen The Post by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who gave a harrowing account of her personal experience during the capital attack.  We're getting an eye opening new look inside last month's siege on the US Capitol. Ocasio Cortez describing the impact of the riots, sharing details about what happened to her during the insurrection at the Capitol, telling her viewers she felt like she was going to die.  All of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on my door like this, like I'm here.  And the bathroom door starts going like this, like the bathroom door is behind me or rather in front of me. And I'm like this. And the door hinges right here.  And I just hear, where is she? Where is she? And this was the moment.  Where? I thought everything was over, you know, I just happened to. You know, be a spiritual person and be raised in that context, and I really just felt like, you know. If this is the plan for me. Then people will be able to take it from here. Wow. You know, for a lot of us at home, the capital riots were basically an action movie on TV. I mean, it was scary, intense and terrifying, but at the end of the day, we were just watching it.  But an action movie is very different when you are actually in the movie. I mean, AOC and other members of Congress literally thought that they were going to die on a Wednesday afternoon, no less. I mean, nobody should die in the middle of the week. That means you went to work on Monday and Tuesday for nothing. And thank God that no members of Congress were actually hurt. But even just believing that you're going to die is a major trauma.  And ABC handled it way better than I would have. I mean, she was like, if this is where my journey ends, so be it. If I thought about it, I wouldn't be pondering my journey. I'd be trying to delete my browser history. And to everyone out there who's saying, oh, how scared could she really have been? How scared could she have been? Think about how terrified you get when someone knocks on the bathroom door when there isn't even a riot.  Someone's in here. Oh, God, no. They're going to know that I poop. So I'm glad that ABC shed the story because many Republicans in Congress would like to just pretend that this shit never happened, that the lives of Congress members and their staff weren't in danger, and that police officers guarding the Capitol weren't injured and killed. But if there's no accountability, then it becomes easier and easier for it to happen again. And the last thing we need from this action movie is a sequel.  Right. When we come back, we'll look at why hedge funds are so mad about the GameStop uprising. And Ibrahim Scandi is joining us on the show.  So don't go away. What do explorers, an Army officer and a Minnesota insurance salesman have in common, they all wanted to be the first to reach the North Pole, but only one of them made it. I'm Katlehong, science editor at Mental Floss and host of the new podcast The Quest for the North Pole, which dives into the centuries long race to explore the Arctic, find the Northwest Passage and conquer the top of the world with a cast of daring adventurers and some pretty determined amateurs, the race to the poll reveals the human desire to solve mysteries of geography and the soul.  We'll look at the important Arctic expeditions that filled the blank spaces on the map and recognize how indigenous people made them successful. We'll examine what pushed explorers to venture ever farther into the unknown and uncharted and how the climate crisis is changing the Arctic today. Listen to the quest for the North Pole every Friday on the radio app, Apple podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and it could happen here, and boy, it does seem to be happening here.  I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.  The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. By now, you've probably heard about the GameStop uprising, but the biggest thing to happen with video games since it got busted for doping. But if you haven't heard the news, what happened was that some Wall Street hedge funds bets a lot of money that the stock price of the video game store GameStop would fall.  But a bunch of people on Reddit found out about those bets. So they started buying GameStop shares so that the price would go up and the hedge funds would lose a lot of money and lose a lot of money they did in the billions of dollars. So as you can imagine, Wall Street is pretty unhappy with those Reddit investors.  A handful of industry leaders are calling for an investigation because of the angry mob that's formed against them.  Last week was a free market. It was a free for all market, no doubt about it.  For my twenty five years in the business, I've never seen this form of collusion on such a widespread fashion. This type of behavior is not the behavior that you want to be replicating. I think there is something obviously wrong, and it's the gamification of Wall Street.  Talk to an analyst this morning, guys, who said this is dangerous. They forget they're buying a stock in a piece of a company. It's not just some symbol that you play hot potato with it.  Just because you throw the Hail Mary pass in your back yard and it's caught for the touchdown in the wind. Doesn't mean you're Tom Brady.  What's going through my mind is how irrelevant I feel and how every day I just don't want to get out of bed and how it's the least amount of fun I think I've ever had.  Oh, read these Wall Street guys are taking this so hard that the interviews are just turning into therapy sessions.  I feel so irrelevant right now and I'm not having any fun. And I just remembered my parents never hung my paintings on the refrigerator.  But the truth is, what the Redskins did here is nothing new. In fact, the only thing that makes this so unique is that this is just the first time that the little guy has used the big guys tactics against him, because when it comes to manipulating the market and treating trades like a game, no one is better at it than Wall Street."}]}

Of course I am. What you excited about? It's going to fill the court with constitutional loving Americans. Again, that court has been too liberal for too long. Really? Of course it you're pro-life. Of course, it's important for Americans to do whatever they can to protect a human life. Yes. Why aren't you wearing a mask? I mean, again, it's a personal choice.  I think if everybody was wearing them and everybody said, put a mask on, I respect everybody's wishes and put it on. We're not sheep. You're not cheap. But if everybody here was wearing masks, if everybody was wearing. But again, we're not sheep. You're not. We're not. Are you going to look at what everybody's doing and you're going to. That's it. Yeah, but not people. Not people.  As the not sheep were bravely running into a tightly packed airplane hangar to see Patient Zero, I couldn't help but think of D-Day and the beaches of Normandy. I don't know which side they're on. As I trace the spread of bullshit, I was fearful for those most vulnerable whose defenses were already compromised about two months before covid started.  I somebody. Put me on the queue and I believe some of it, and I don't believe some of it, but I believe only so much can be a conspiracy. I think a lot of it's true.  You know, about Kuhnen, is there anything you can tell us that I don't know, JFK Jr. is still alive.  What? This guy is always behind Trump at the rally.  So you're saying JFK Jr. is still alive and spending his time in the background, a Trump rally from Cuidad? Yes. Do you think racism exists in America? I do not believe that people hate each other as much as, you know, racism is a problem in America. I do not think it's a problem now. There's a potential that JFK Jr. is alive and here at a Trump rally.  It may be hilarious, but with just over a month until the voters go to the polls, had the president somehow already contaminated election, Biden is elected?  Uh huh. You trust the results now with our cheater's. But if Trump wins, do you trust the results? Yes, absolutely. I think mail in ballots is not going to be fair because it leads to fraud and stuff. You don't you don't trust mail in ballots at all. The president uses mail in ballots, right? Yeah. They're going to use mail in ballots for this upcoming election. Right. But the president himself uses mail in ballots.  Oh, he does where? He does how he votes. He mailed it in. Yes. If I was a diver, I don't I don't know. I honestly know that. Oh, you know what you're talking. But you do know step after hours in the heavily contaminated parking lot.  I want wanted to self quarantine and chill, but I still had one burning question.  Are you in a better place than you were four years ago? Absolutely. Absolutely. Is America a better place than they were before? I believe absolutely. We have higher unemployment. We have 200000 people dead due to cover and we have riots in the street.  Yes. Let me just tell you this much. Yes, I'm doing much better. I'm literally making four times as much as I was making when Obama was president. What do you do? I work for a debt relief company. Yeah. So now as a debt relief employee, you make more money under Donald Trump. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good to be a white debt relief collector. After an historic 227 year campaign, I found myself at another Trump rally, one of three he was having in Pennsylvania that very day.  And while there was still some of the usual totally realistic expectations, I'm calling 47 states the Trump at this rally in the final week of election season, I noticed something different.  It was quiet, but people just tired.  You know, I think people I think people are exhausted. Me, too. And I'm ready to move on.  I've been to a lot of Trump rallies before, and I have to say this is probably the most subdued rally I've been to. It's eerily quiet. You can hear a kuhnen push notification, dig in someone's pocket.  This was a chance to hear Trump make his final case. And frankly, for Muga country to do the same talk about the economy, he provided jobs.  And when people are working and not out looting and burning cities, historically, this presidency has lost more jobs than any other country. That's not true. He hasn't. He has. I feel like I need my heat. I think, in fact, what's on the fact sheet? The fact is that in my car we have not had a fact sheet before. This is really brilliant. I'm bringing it. I hope it doesn't have a list of all the dead, because I think it's going to be huge, OK, jobs added four million under Phaidon and Obama negative two point one.  What is the Web site? I don't know. So you don't have to Google it.  OK, so her friend didn't have the facts, but she did have the Zinfandel.  Let's talk about African-American paintings and all the things we've done for that. Great. What are they done with the. You know, when he was corrected, the you got to help me out here. Can come here while I waited for Tony to get her shit together. I wanted to wrap my head around their Hail Mary October surprise. And that's Hunter Biden and his. Well, I'll just let them explain it.  You can see on Fox and one American news about the the laptop, the Biden's laptop and then all the corruption, taking money from the different countries, you know, from Russia and China. And Joe Biden would do whatever these countries needed. What did to do? Well, he would either what he did or did not do. What didn't what did it do? You have to be determined exactly what he did.  I saw paedophilia in China, something I do believe in. I don't know. I that's something I have to look into a lot more. We see about like the Hunter Biden scandal. What exactly happened with that? I think they they found a laptop that had, you know, emails and there was the FBI. They found a laptop with like emails and pictures of, you know, Biden talking with like Ukraine and China about business deals and stuff like that, which Biden, Hunter, Biden did.  Did something happen? They want to push it to get it, you know, get the investigation under way before the election. But what's the investigation all about? The laptop and on what was on the laptop? I mean, could the conspiracy theorists would say that it's Joe Biden and Hunter Biden communicating with outside countries on business deals and stuff like that? Are you calling him a conspiracy theorist? That's just what he said. Right.  The conspiracy, because only because it hasn't been proven to make a ton of money and do absolutely nothing except that, hey, you can meet my dad. That's a disgusting trait, right? To just use your father's name to make money off of that.  Absolutely. Nepotism needs to be looked into big time. Yes. What do you think about Ivanka? Oh, she's so gracious. I see Ivanka as someone who is following or creating and enhancing people's lives around jobs and training and whatever causes she has, just like Lady Diana had 20 years ago, she had certain causes, AIDS and different things like that. She was involved with Lady Diana seeking copyrights in China while she had a position of power. I don't know what you're talking about.  As the horn rang in, the masses filed into the last rally, there was a bittersweet feeling in the air. Folks are not. And this the last chance for them to get unfettered access to the United States after after this and maybe through Plexiglas, maybe with a telephone, if this somber attitude was a reflection of what could happen on Election Day, are these folks prepared for a world post?  Trump Trump can totally win if for some chance he doesn't win. What happens to all of this afterwards? Me personally, I'm sure I will not live under a socialist government and just look up the three red flags on the Biden campaign poster. There's three red lines. Yeah. Look it up on Google. Well, I think it's an E it's supposed to be an E, but look at the three red flags or three red banners and they mean communism.  He's not communism right there on the flag. You got it. Really? You don't want to be in a place of socialized medicine. So where would you go? I'm going to look at Costa Rica, Costa Rica, which has universal health care. Yeah. I mean, I'm just I'm not going to live under socialist rule. I don't think Biden's going to make the four years and the CamelBak. Forget it. The CamelBak. Who's at Hamala. Oh, wow.  That bug mispronounced the name and xenophobic. Yeah, absolutely. Wow. That's a twofer. If they don't take in Costa Rica, I'm sure Argentina would welcome you and your point of view with open arms.  So the pitches have been made and the escape routes planned. Nothing left to do other than vote your asses off and hope we get the results soon. Until then, I'll be hiding out right here. Good luck, America. Trump's people were gathering. So I went to Washington, D.C., to the self-proclaimed and self counted million Muga March, where moms for Trump good dads and free jazz instrumentalists for Trump.  Converge to do what exactly we have to celebrate that we. Oh, you're four years too late. You're four years too late. I wanna know if you find this to you, not the size of the flag that matters, it's how many votes you get.  The Electoral College system, they were here to celebrate the fact that America is a rich, diverse nation with so many different kinds of alleged election fraud people.  There's people that's that's changing votes. Who people across across the United States. Where did you hear this? All over. We can't ignore we're talking about having 10 people vote. No. One, should Trump have appealed more to the dead person vote? Should he appeal? We just need fairness. To me. The biggest fraud is, unfortunately, the millions of voters that voted for Biden that were brainwashed by the media. Everybody on their flag. It's a big flag.  Yes. Those are not an American flag. The Stars and Stripes on her brother can appreciate it. You know, it feels like it's mostly Donald Trump obscuring. Appreciate if you don't stand, to be honest, if anybody is disrespecting the flag, I think it's the 10 foot high. Donald Trump. I have an analogy in the NFL, there's a close play. What are they? Do they review it? Right. And sometimes it takes some 15 minutes to leave the game.  They're going to look at every little technicality. Let me do one. I got an analogy. It's like the NFL. There's a game, OK? It's the Lions versus the Packers. The Lions lose. Everybody goes home. But the Lions stay on the field and they say we didn't lose. And everybody's like, well, if you look at the scoreboard, it's like, oh, you can lose from what?  He had less votes. Oh, yeah, yeah. But you got to take California out of the equation and he wins the national. If you definitely discount certain people, then the numbers add up in your favor. OK, what one in Flagstaff is stole it going blatantly. What's what's the evidence. The mail in ballots. First of all, we all know the whole corona was to send the mail in ballots. How to steal the election along with the voting machines are all compromised.  So anyway, the corona was created to create damage. The Democrats are working with the communist Chinese to put Biden in because because China has blackmail on Joe Biden. That is a fact that on any true love, no people are stealing our elections. This is our country. People are stealing our life. How are they stealing the election? Because they're putting voter fraud suspicious. How are they putting voter fraud? Department of Homeland Security Services, the most secure election Americans lose out.  That's one guy like you and me, Bruce, if that's done, OK, I like you, Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security. And so because one person says something that's good, that's what it is. It's the government and the court. Trump's lawyer said there's no fraud. Don't try and twist the big politics for a long time. Don't try to ask me that. You're in politics. I am the regional Tea Party chairman. You're the Tea Party.  I'm the Tea Party member of the original Tea Party chairman at the breakfast. Read you. Come on. Thank you. What? You got yourself a safe space. We are patient. Let me get this straight. You're yelling at me to find a safe space and you have elevated yourself with a megaphone and you have a shield.  They were having trouble facing the reality at hand, though. There were occasional signs of progress, something fitting about a U-Haul truck here.  Yet no one seems to acknowledge that Trump's legal defense is crumbling.  It doesn't matter, though, for these guys. Some battles never end.  What does is that Trump that's Trump on a Confederate flag. That's Confederate flag. Yeah, that's still left. Come on. But you don't know how to pick a winner. You might as well put a Jets hat on.  And they don't trust this election's narrative, which the rest of the world is seen. What do they trust? I trust Trump and what he says, what he knows. You know, I don't trust the media that much. So the only person you really believe is Donald Trump himself. That's not the only person. Who else do you believe? I mean, ultimately, I believe Jesus is king and I believe the Bible like to Jesus and Trump. Now, I trust a lot of people, my friends, my family.  Are you saying Tucker Carlson, Tucker Carlson, Jesus and Donald Trump and more. I could go on and on. No, I think I get the picture. We used to like Fox. We don't like Fox. We don't like MSNBC. We don't like CBS. We don't like any of the fake news channels because they lie all the time. What happened to Fox? Was it their covid coverage that turned, you know, what about had it?  I like Hannity, Tucker, Tucker and Tucker.  So just two hours everyday of Fox News. Otherwise it's a complete boycott. Yes, absolutely. Even Fox wasn't welcome at this mug a palooza, which was feeling less like the peace and love of Woodstock and more like the buzz kill at Altamont. Get are signaling the end of an era complete with actual knife violence. The liberal media. I have one word for you. You are controlled by the deep state. That's like four, five or six words.  Ten words. That's even two. That one's even to make news. I have no idea how the silent majority works. That's that's two words alone and no one in the muggle world. Kont.

Hope is more powerful than fear, and light is more powerful and dark. This is our moment. This is our mission. And this is a battle we will win and we'll do it together. I promise you so it's a great honor and humility, I accept this nomination for president of the United States of America.  I'm not going to lie watching Biden give the speech was nerve racking, it was like watching the quiet place, one wrong step and the whole thing is over. But honestly, he nailed it. He showed strength. He showed emotion. He made a powerful case for a more united America.  And I actually think that Trump did Biden the biggest favor by making it seem like he's incompetent and senile. I mean, the bar has been set super low. As soon as America saw Biden had his jacket on the right way around, they were ready to give him a standing ovation. Biden, speaking in complete sentences, was just the icing on the cake. And last night also reminded us how different these candidates are. I mean, you've got the presidential candidate who's casually quoting Danish philosophers and Irish poets, and then you've got the president whose morning read is the back of a cereal box.  You're right, Tony. They are great. Not as great as America, but show great.  Let's really sit down and talk about what we learned, you know, take some time to analyze the policy disagreements, think through the important issues, pass the nuances of the question is, is the question left?  Would you say you graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class? This is the hunt you got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged. That's not true. What was it to use? Wait a minute. You get the final word? Well, it's hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me. Let me just tell you, there's nothing smart about you, Joe. Forty seven years you've done the worst America has ever had.  Oh, snap. These guys were bickering so much. Canada called the cops to complain about the noise. I have never seen a debate like that in my life, to be honest. I've never seen anything like that in my life. Honestly, it seemed less like a presidential debate and more like a fight that you overhear in a booth at Denny's while you shut up, you clown. You got no class. I got no class. You got terrible grades and your sons are cool.  Can you present a shit? You don't talk about my son. You listen. Yeah. Hi. Could I get the the moons over my hammy with the orange juice, please? Yeah, that'll be all. Thank you so much.  You got drunk and you hit on your own daughter. I wasn't drunk.  I mean, some of these insults were way more personal than you ever seen a debate, especially Biden calling Trump a clown. Which guys, I'm sorry, man. That's not fair to Trump, right? Clowns wear with makeup. They have clothes that are too big for them. They're deeply sad even when they don't show it. Does that sound like Donald Trump to you? Now, let's just be clear. The reason that this debate was such a colossal train wreck is because Donald J.  Trump was throwing grenades on the tracks and usually in a debate, the moderator is there to prevent things from getting out of hand. But last night's moderator, Chris Wallace, was about as successful at stopping Trump as the popular votes.  The country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that well, and him too. Well, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting Obama I get rid of. I'd like we will press president on the moderator of this debate. And I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer. No, sir. It's just I understand you've agreed to the two minutes, so please, I don't have a shirt you made.  No, just made a point. But don't answer. And Mr. President, to answer, the second subject is covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it.  You're doing it. You're going to have a true gentleman. I hate to raise my voice seems to be why should I be different than the two of you? So you've been talking you made a statement. I'm asking you. I would love to know, sir. I would love to know if you want to switch seats. We could very quickly. We can do that.  Oh, man, that is so sad. Trump was being such a child that Chris Wallace actually had to pull the. Do you want to switch seats, move that English teachers use their students. And honestly, I'm glad that Trump didn't take him up on it, because if Trump takes over Wallace's job, then Wallace has to take over Trump's job. And I don't know if he has an intent to kill two hundred thousand people.  Now, this is all happening after a chaotic, nerve wracking election night that featured all types of weird moments, predictions flipping left and right, ballots being delivered with a police escort, Steve Kanakis Kalki. But but maybe what's weirdest is that after all of that, the night actually ended up going mostly as everyone expected. You know, Trump jumped ahead early and a lot of states because Republicans mostly voted in person and those votes got counted first.  And then as the Democratic mail in ballots came in, Biden jumped ahead, which is what everyone knew might happen for weeks when everyone except the president of the United States, we were winning everything and all of a sudden it was just called off.  The results tonight have been phenomenal. And we are getting ready. I mean, literally, we were just all set to get outside and just celebrate something that was so beautiful, so good. We had such a big night. You just take a look at all of these states that we've won tonight, and then you take a look at the kind of margins that we've won. But we won states and all of a sudden I said, what happened to the election?  It's off. And we have all these announcers saying, what happened?  And then they said, oh, yeah, dude, because first they counted your votes and now they're counting the other guy's votes. I mean, I knew that Trump didn't like science, but I didn't realize he had disavowed numbers. I mean, maybe this explains why he's always in debt. This is just a level of stupidity from Trump that I did not expect. He always exceeds the levels of stupidity. We can go higher. Sometimes it feels like Trump is an actual toddler.  First I had a nose, then suddenly my uncle stole it and I had no known what happened, you know, nor folks, I don't have a nose anymore. Although Trump could be playing four dimensional chess here. Yeah, maybe he's laying the groundwork for his legal defense over his taxes. Your Honor, as you can see, I have no idea how our numbers work. Therefore, I cannot be held accountable. Case dismissed, sir. You cannot dismiss your own case.  I also don't know how the law works. Double case dismissed. Hashtag winning. But yeah, needless to say, Donald Trump was upset.  The more votes got counted, the more Biden pulled ahead of him. And for Donald Trump, they could only be one solution. Stop counting the votes.  Something just breaking in the last couple of minutes as well. Things are moving fast and furiously with the president's campaign. The campaign manager, Bill Stepien, announcing that the Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit in the state of Michigan, saying President Trump's campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots in the counting process is guaranteed by Michigan law. We have filed suit today in the Michigan court of claims to halt counting.  This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country.  We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.  This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at four o'clock in the morning and add them to the list.  OK, it's it's a very sad it's a very sad moment to me.  This is a very sad moment and we will win this. And as far as I'm concerned, we already have one.  Wow. I know everyone was expecting it, but still, can we just take a moment to to admit that it is insane that an American president is just demanding that they stop that they stop counting votes while he's ahead? This is a textbook authoritarian move, which is impressive coming from a guy who's never read a textbook. And I got to say, for a guy who hates shithole countries, Trump really likes to jack that style.  CNN projects Joseph R. Biden Jr. is elected the forty six president of the United States.  There was jubilance as people flooded the streets today, celebrating from the White House to the West Coast, celebrations in the streets in New York City, the tri state and across the world on the streets of the largest cities today, a party.  And President Trump's hometown, New York City, Biden supporters shouted out their windows, there were bands and champagne.  Costumes in tears, an impromptu dance party broke out.  You had Sweet Caroline singalongs and na na na goodbye singalongs. Oh yeah.  What a day. What a day. What a day. Now, people were out in the streets dancing. They were partying. People were singing Sweet Caroline, which was genius because any celebration that's singing Sweet Caroline isn't going to get broken up by the cops. For real, though, this was an amazing weekend. It was such a festive atmosphere. The Saturday was amazing. Everyone was so happy.  Even coronaviruses like you guys have fun. I'm taking the day off. No, I'm kidding. I'm dreading it now. But yes, that's right, people.  This weekend, Joseph Reanna Biden was declared the forty six presidents of the United States.  I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did let this of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Wow. I don't know about you guys, but after four years of having to listen to Trump, a normal presidential speech was was almost weird. I was listening to the speech like, wait, so we're not blaming anything on Hillary? Nothing.  And let's be honest at this point, I bet even Trump's people want Biden to lower the temperature. I mean, mainly because half of them are running a fever from covid.  Still, though, I'm sure that they were happy to hear Biden say let the grim demonization begin to end. Although I do like how Biden didn't say, let's end it, he said, let's begin to end it now, like it'll be too dangerous to just stop demonizing all at once. We've got to stop being mean to each other in this country next week.  But for now, what the hell is going on with Mitch McConnell? You see, that shit looks like he's got boloney fingers.  But the truth is, Biden was calling for healing and he was promising to work just as hard for the people who didn't vote for him as the people who did. And after these last few years, I think that's a nice sentiments. Although the truth is the country so divided, I don't know how that would work in real life. You know, is Biden really going to try and cater to both because everyone is so far apart? I'm going to listen to Dr.  Fauci and then, of course, I will behead him. And to reach across the aisle, I will find my son Hunter and look him up. Am I a good president or what?  The point is, people, it's genuinely going to take some time getting used to speeches that sound like speeches. But otherwise, for Biden Harris, it was a flawlessly choreographed evening.  Well, except for one moment when a confetti cannon went off and based on the candidate's reactions, it doesn't look like they were expecting it.  Cheese, that was terrifying.  I don't know about you, but when I saw that the black part of me in the movie theater came out as a get out of Joe, but I don't think, you know, this is actually something I think we need to address as a planet. People we have to stop celebrating with things that sound like gunfire, fireworks, confetti cannons, popping champagne corks, all of it. Half the time. I'm like, who did something good happen or should going down?  I don't need to be starting like this anymore, people. And neither does Joe Biden or you blowing up things next to Joe Biden. At this point, Joe Biden's campaign should be wrapping him in bubble wrap and storing him in the attic until Inauguration Day.

It really is amazing that you not only recovered, but then made it a mission to educate other people about how to stay safe. I mean, like, you know, you're a lifelong New Yorker.  When you agreed to go to press conferences with Governor Cuomo, when you agreed to be part of these briefings, when you agreed to be part of this, what were you hoping to help achieve for New York as a whole, for them to wake up, to understand how deadly and how serious this was and that we had to respect each other just like that doctor said to me in Bangkok, you know, I wanted New Yorkers to respect one another. I wanted Americans to respect one another by wearing a mask.  It's just that simple. I've helped the governor with other things, like with his Hurricane Maria relief and all of that stuff. But for him to call me, I said, well, I told my husband, I said, isn't that crazy how the world works? When I was there at that press conference, I was holding back the emotions I really was because I didn't want to to to have that be the focus.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. I just wanted to be very adult and mature and say, listen, man, this is real messed up. It's as simple as that. If that can help, do it, do it.  Let's talk about the new show. It is generating quite the buzz and it's a really fun conceit. You know, the flight attendant when I saw the title, I was like, oh, this is cute. What is this going to be like, a romantic comedy? Is this going to be just like a straight comedy? And it's like, no, this is a dark, but sometimes funny and really gripping show about like a murder mystery. And when the show started, I remember being like, oh, Rosie, this is wonderful.  You're playing such a nice character. This is great. But now I'm not so sure and I don't know what's coming up because the show we can't binge on it comes out weekly. But it seems like you play a really shady character in this world.  You will find out. You will find out. I'd like to say I can't, but Megan is my character, Megan Briscoe. She's definitely keeping a big, fat secret. And and it's it's slowly going to be tearing her apart. And and also, she I love playing this character because at first the executive producers had in mind her being a little bit more tough. And I said, no, this woman is menopausal. She hates her life, her middle class life, which is actually fabulous, but she just can't see it.  And she her only friend is Kasey Bowdon Callicles character who doesn't feel the same way about her. I said, that's pretty sad. That's pretty sad. Right? Without judging her, I wanted to bring something special to it, you know what I mean? And I know exactly what you mean.  Yeah. What attracted you to the show? Why did you go Noize? Rosie Perez. I'm going to do the show.  A drunk flight attendant that sleeps with first class passengers and then wakes up next to one of her conquests and he's dead. I wasn't.  But actually, I turned it down. I did. I turned it down initially because I can't stand traveling. I detest it. I hate the whole thing. Really? Yes. I cannot stand it.  And the show went to locations around the globe. Yes.  That's what Kelly Kelly Kelly Cocozza, to her credit, refused to take no for an answer and met with no. And she said, you know, it's called a flight attendant. I said, yes, that's why I'm saying no. And and we were cracking up. And after an hour, that was supposed to be ten minutes, she charmed my ass off. She just did it. She did it. But inside I was like, oh, my God, I'm so in and so in.  And I was so glad I'm so glad she she she did that. And because we had a blast and everybody on the cast is stellar, just really. Oh, I loved it.  Yeah. Well, I'll tell you now, I'm glad that she chewed you shoot your head off for not doing it. I'm glad. She pushed you, I'm glad that you said yes, because it's amazing seeing you on anything, but really in this show has been a ton of fun. I can't wait to see what the secret is. Rosie Perez, thank you so much for joining me on the show.  Thank you.  Don't forget, the flight attendant is available now on HBO Max. Well, that's our show for tonight. But before we go, you may have heard, but there's an important runoff election coming up in Georgia.

So there are a number of people in our society who know that drugs are not the boogeyman and not the devil that we've been told, but they are comfortable doing the activity for themselves. But they don't want anybody else doing this. Right. Right. And remember that.  And then what do you say to the communities out there, especially black communities, where community will go like Dr. Hart, what are you doing? We watched the crack epidemic destroy our communities. Why would you advocate for drugs?  Yes, I'm not advocating for drugs, but I'm just saying that if people are using drugs, we shouldn't throw them away because of their drug use. We should look at their other. That's what I'm saying, number one. And number two is that when we talk about the crack epidemic destroying the black community, it was just wrong. I mean, it's true that people have problems, but when we think about things like unemployment, the highest unemployment rates in the United States in black communities was nineteen eighty two.  Crack didn't come on the scene until nineteen eighty five. But yet crack is blamed for that sort of thing. We think about violence. We had peaks in violence in nineteen thirty three, 1980, 1991. Crack was on the scene in eighty five for the ninety one month. But we've had these periodic peaks in violence. That's how, that's how societies work. And so crack was blamed for these things that were really caused by things like Reaganomics and Reagan's economic policies.  But butt crack was blame. And so I'm trying to get people to understand that if you look beyond drugs, then we might find some real solutions. Right.  Well, I can talk to you for ages, but luckily, that's why you wrote the book. I hope people read it before they comment on it, because it's one of the most thought provoking reads that I've that I've had the pleasure of exploring a in a very long time. Dr. Hart, thank you for taking the time. I appreciate you coming on.  Thank you for having me. And I really appreciate you. Thank you so much. Always a pleasure.

Do you have any normal. You know, honestly, you when you come to America, I think you've said this before about the eating, so there's the first couple of months of just eating and thinking that it's not going to go anywhere.  And then you want to go home and everyone says, my goodness, I'm never quite so good to you.  So I try not to eat a lot. But also, I love chicken sandwiches. I didn't think much of I do. I enjoy chicken sandwiches. What's the most American thing that. Oh, the crossing of the street was kind of hard for me in the beginning, honestly looking the wrong way.  Yeah, I trying not to die in America. Yes. Very expensive to transport a body home. So yeah. That was just those, those kind of things that I was going through. But I honestly, it's very hard to come into a new country as a person who's on the other side. I had a lot of culture shock, a lot of culture shock, but there's a lot of learning as well.  So, I mean, what do I do? I haven't hiked I haven't done I haven't done the normal touristy things. I haven't gone to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. So, you know, I'm taking it slow.  Oh, I love it. So what you need to do is I'll give you a few tips for L.A. what you need to do, you need to get like a really nice dog and then you need to go for a hike, but then you need to dress as if you didn't care. But you have to dress as if you're on a runway and then you go for the hike and then make sure you don't sweat, but make it look like you were working.  Exactly. And I have a bottle of water as well. But it must be like a like a like a special type of bottle. It must be a bottle that says something about you as a person. Very natural but not too natural. And then. Yeah. And then and then just enjoy yourself but don't be yourself. Just be who you who you think you should be and you'll have a good time for me.  I don't think I can be able to do it and I don't know.  Can I tell you that. No, but can I tell you the thing for real though, is that's the great thing about what you're doing. What a lot of people do is you are you and people are loving you for that. I think that's why you're successful in the movie. You play the character fantastically. And I think when people meet the real gnomes in real life, they go like, wow, she's even more of a princess in real life.  So I think you're gonna experience more success, more joy, and you have no risk of somebody taking away that passport. Thank you so much for joining me on the show.

I don't think that's fair, especially in a country that's got a hundred different ways to spell. Alison, how do you for allies in your name, Alison? Now, a lot of people do realize that this system is a problem.  In fact, states were recently given the power to require electors to follow the will of the people. Unfortunately, very few of them actually do.  In the past term, the Supreme Court upheld the right of the states to insist that electors vote for the person who won the popular vote. But here's the deal. Only 14 of the 50 states actually have that legal requirement in those 14 states. If if the faithless elector goes rogue, the state can throw them out on the street and get somebody else in to vote, according to the popular vote. But in all the rest of the states, if a faithless elector goes off on their own two, there's nothing the state can do about it except find them.  Really? Electors can subvert the will of the voters and undermine the foundations of democracy, and their punishment is the same as parking in front of a fire hydrant. In fact, parking in front of a hydrant is even worse because you don't just get a fine, you'll also get towed. I mean, charging someone a thousand dollars for giving the presidency to someone doesn't mean that they won't do it. It just means the bidding starts at a thousand dollars. Now, the good news is Trump has done so many electors that it's unlikely he can convince enough of them to turn against their state's voters and vote for him.  But the bad news is it's easy to see how a future election could be close enough that the losing candidates could convince enough electors to make them the winning candidates. And it would be totally legal. The Daily Show with Criminal Ears Edition, watch The Daily Show weeknights at 11:00, 10:00 Central on Comedy Central and the Comedy Central.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show, here is more of my conversation with President Barack Obama. We talked about leadership and what he wrestled with the most as presidents.  You've studied leadership programs not just in South Africa, but all over the world. The Obama Foundation has set about on a journey to inspire young people to grow up to become leaders growing up in South Africa. I was taught about the different levels of what a struggle is going to be. You know, the freedom fighters may not necessarily be the best politicians, the best politicians may not necessarily be the best leaders, the best activists may not be the best organizers and so on and so forth.  Everyone has a role to play in trying to get to a certain place. And so I wonder, when you set up these this leadership academy that's all over the globe, you know, you're clearly trying to create mini Obamas everywhere, which is probably like a fever dream of the right. But what you what you're trying to do is create something specific. And I would like to know what that is. What do you what do you believe a leader is not just somebody who's in power, but a leader?  The program we did in Johannesburg, we gathered up two hundred young leaders from 50 countries on the continent of Africa, and it was as varied. You had young women who had started rural health clinics. Yeah.  You had MPs who had taken a more conventional political route. You had entrepreneurs. The thing they all had in common, though, was this this sense not only that the world could be better and that they had a role to play in it, but also the belief that they couldn't do it by themselves and that they had to in some ways unlock the potential and power of other people. A speech I gave in Johannesburg in conjunction with that is for the anniversary of Mandela's 100th anniversary where I contrasted that.  Sort of democratic, inclusive leadership to the strongman leadership that in some ways we've seen ascendant in certain parts of the world in some ways has was ascendant here in the United States.  And those are two different stories of what it means to be a leader and and power and that conflict, that battle between a more democratic, inclusive vision and one that's top down dominance subordinate. That's a contest that's taking place here in the United States and around the world. And it's not going to be finished just because the election's over and Donald Trump was defeated because you see examples of this in the Philippines and Hungary in a variety of countries in Africa and Asia.  And so that that contest is going to continue.  What I find fascinating about the conversation that a lot of Americans are having now, and you talk about this in the book as well, is how America's influence in the world has diminished over the past few years, how how countries around the world have no longer said, what is America doing? We'll work with them. It's it's been more like, no, guys, we can't wait for America. We're doing our own thing. But I wonder, as somebody who has grown up in other parts of the world, as someone who has family in other parts of the world, is there an argument that maybe that's a good thing, that the world doesn't follow America anymore?  Or what what would the what would the inverse of that argument be like? Should the world follow America or is it time for the world to start doing its own thing? And America should be less the world police, I think.  It is a good thing that other countries catch up and have their own capabilities and their own agency. That's not something that I think America should fear. My argument would be that even in a more multipolar world where you don't have just one big power, but you have other countries who are coming into their own, the principles that America articulated at its best about rule of law, human rights, freedom of speech, democracy, those values, at least I choose to believe, are not exclusively American.  Yeah, you as somebody who lived in South Africa.  No, the the the play that in other countries, sometimes you hear where somebody who's doing something entirely for power and money and influence will say if they're criticized, you say, you know, you've been just influenced by Western thinking that that's colonial thinking. No, no, no, no. You are stealing from your people don't. And when we criticize, you don't don't claim that somehow this is some American hegemony being asserted against you. We're calling you on the fact that you're a thief.  I think it's important for us to to to. To recognize that for all its failings, the values that America is often articulated on the world stage have been ones that I would still believe in and that a lot of people took comfort from. And when we are not asserting them, oftentimes they don't you know, they don't play out on the world stage.  I sometimes wondered if you ever grappled with the difficulty of the paradox that America was creating and what it was trying to do in the world and then what its actions were sometimes creating in the world. You know, I mean, I think about that in the Middle East wars that have been started under false pretenses, people who have been killed, who had nothing to do, you know. And so I wonder, as someone who had to make decisions and someone who was in that leadership position, do you sometimes grapple with how America did or did not help itself in how it acted with the world?  Because in the world, like I'll tell you, as an international person, we would oftentimes go like men. Yes, America's great. And it's doing wonderful things. But then you'd be like, but also men. Sometimes they just break the rules and no one can say anything about it. Absolutely.  And I record examples in the book of where I'm grappling with this. Right. And one of the interesting challenges of being president, the United States. But I think being head of government or state in any country is you inherit a legacy. Right. So if I come in as president and. I can't undo the Iraq war, the decision to go into Iraq now, I can manage as best I can how we can wind down that war, mitigate some of the damage that's been done, but I can't reverse it.  Do you ever did you ever envy, though, how like Trump just came in and basically broke shit, though? Because, I mean, he didn't care?  No, I didn't envy it because I do care. And I do not think that is an option to simply pretend that the legacy of problems or issues that you inherit are somehow things you can just brush aside. So the answer is yes, I. I would struggle with the fact that any action I took, particularly when you're talking about. Know counterterrorism, right? That's probably the area where I wrestled with this most because my obligation first and foremost. In the United States was to make sure that people didn't get hurt.  That's sort of the bare minimum that you expect out of a nation state that you're living in is that you can defend against harm because you're dealing with non-state actors. That meant that by the time I took office, you had networks that were embedded in societies not necessarily supported by those societies, but they're there and they are plotting and they're planning. And that wasn't made up. And there were organizations that if they could blow up the New York subway system, they would if they could get their hands on a biological weapon, they would use it.  You then are wrestling with how do I protect? The American people from those actors. But do it in a way that is morally and ethically justified and war is madness, kinetic action of any sort.  Military action of any sort that results in death and destruction. At a certain level is not the thing I would want humanity to do and what happens to people is tragic. It is not it is not something you gloss over what what what it does to our soldiers and our troops. You know, as I talk about in the book, it's not just the harm that our young men and women suffered. And I would witness in Walter Reed, but it's also how it changes them internally when they have engaged in violence, even if necessary and justified against others.  So the best I could come up with was to never glorify it, to never pretend like it isn't a dilemma. And so those kinds of questions, I think, are ones that. Not only should American leaders have to grapple with, but I think the American people have to be aware and sometimes the media does not do a very good job. It's a very binary, you know, the Iraq war, it's glorious for the first year and a half and then suddenly it's not.  Yes. And we're shocked that. That's invading another country might turn out to be messy. Hopefully that's not a lesson we have to repeatedly relearn when we come back.  President Obama talks about how he really feels about the Black Lives Matter movement.  Stay tuned. My name is Jamie Leftest, host of shows like My Year in Mensa and the Bacto Cast. I'm here to tell you about my new show, Lolita podcast Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov is one of the most controversial works in American history. The story and its main character have been adapted, misinterpreted and twisted over the years by Hollywood, by fashion, by fans of the book and by the author himself. Lolita has gone from the tragic story of an abused 13 year old girl to a cultural narrative that frames her as the seductress and to blame.  So how did this all happen? It's a messy story. This is a story about a girl named Dolores, and I think she's gotten lost over the years. I'll be speaking with literary scholars, with expert unobvious and with the actors who have played the part of Lolita and more. So let's get to the bottom of it for her new episodes. Drop weekly on Mondays. Listen to Lolita podcast on The Hurt radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you listen to podcast.  Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Here is more of my conversation with President Obama. He told me how he would talk about police reform with white folks and with people like Michelle's mom and why progressives should avoid taking cues from the Republican Party.  20 20 was a year for many of racial reckoning. It was the year when people of all ages took to the streets, black and white alike, and said, we need to change the way the police deal with people in this country, predominantly black people in this country. It was an interesting time as well, because, I mean, your presidency, as you know better than anyone and people thought, well, that is it. We're now in a post-racial utopia.  Barack Obama is in the White House. We have half black, half whites, all black. Good times. Let's have a good one. And then people saw that there was still a lot of work to be done.  Let's talk a little bit about the movement as you see it.  Some of the problem I have with headline sometimes is like people take things out of context, et cetera. But some activists criticize you for saying they've got to be careful of snappy slogans like defund the police because it loses people. But I wonder, do you think that the slogan is off is the thing that makes people for or against you? Or do you think people are just going to be for or against you? And then the slogan doesn't really mean as much.  And what I mean by that is like like Donald Trump's Make America great again. It's not a it's not a very divisive slogan. If you look at it on the face of it, that's a great slogan. Why would anyone not want to make America great again? But the subtext is something else. When you're thinking of that as someone who's great at slogans, by the way, I mean, yes, we can it's snappy. It works.  Although as I said in the book, I actually thought it was corny.  I didn't I didn't like it when when my team came up with it. And then they went to ask Michelle and Michelle said, no, it's not corny, it's fine. So clearly, she had a better political brain than I did on this. I'm glad you actually brought this up, because you know, what's been fascinating while I've been on this book tour is, you know, people have asked me what's my source of optimism? And uniformly, what I have said is nothing made me more optimistic during a very difficult year than the activism that we saw in the wake of George Floyds Murder and Black Lives Matter.  And I have consistently believed that their courage. Activisms, media savvy, strategic resolve far exceeds anything that I could have done it at their age and I think has shifted the conversation in ways that I would not have even imagined a couple of years ago. So throughout this slew of compliments. I then said, well, what do you think about the particular slogan, defund the police? And I said, well, that particular slogan, I think. The concern is that there may be potential allies out there that you lose and the issue always is.  How do you get enough people to support your cause that you can actually institutionalize it and translate it into laws, right structures and so forth?"}]}

We get to tell the fans all of the behind the scenes stories that actually happened to them as they watch every episode of the beloved 90s TV show from the very beginning.  Listen to Ninio two and OMD on the I Heart radio app or wherever you get your podcasts.  Are you going to filibuster me or because I don't have all the time you want me to be very good. So is this like a roundabout way of saying you just want me to give a short pithy. No, I don't want your question. You want me to speed up? You want me to talk fast?  No, no, no, no. Please, Mr. President, I will not I will not purposely filibuster, but sometimes I will have a pause as I'm formulating my thoughts. As you well know, Michelle, Michelle has been speeding up my auto my my audio book. So, you know, I guess you can press a button. So, yeah. You like point two, five or one and a half. Yes. Yeah. Well, yeah, you were one and a half guy.  You did want to talk.  I was a little offended by that, but that's okay. That's fine.  It does, it doesn't communicate the depth of feeling with which I'm doing the reading but it's OK.  How do you like being referred to.  Like just as a human being. Do you like Mr. President?  People call me Barack, but then sometimes some folks feel awkward doing it. Obviously, that's what my friends call me. So I consider you a friend, but you may feel, you know. So no, no, no.  The people the people will feel like like even Africans will. They'll write me a letter saying, how dare you, this is my fault, too.  So I don't want to get you in trouble. So you can say, Mr. President, makes sense. You can call me Protus.  My favorite one was. Oh, Bizzle. That was my favorite. Please call me that. Mr. President, welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.  I am very happy to be here with you. You're out there promoting a brand new book, A Promised Land, a seven hundred page book, if I may add. I love reading your stuff. Don't get me wrong. But like I would have liked three fifty three fifty.  Why seven hundred pages, you know, I would have, I would have broken it up even more. But, you know, the publishers thought that breaking it up into two volumes would be about right. And look, the goal of the book was to give people a sense of what it's like to be in the White House. Right. As a normal person, finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. And I think part of the goal, particularly for young people, I wanted them to get a sense that, you know, not everybody is going to end up being president.  But if you decide that your voice makes a difference, if you decide that you can have an impact, then through the ups and downs, you will end up having some pretty extraordinary experiences. And one, I wanted to be an encouragement for people to say, you know, the guy is OK, but he's not so special and look what he ended up doing. Maybe I can do something, something as well.  It feels like this book is Barack Obama convincing Barack Obama to remain optimistic? And what I mean by convincing Barack Obama, I think of like a young Barack Obama, I think of a fledgling Barack Obama. I'm not trying to emulate you, per say, but rather anyone who's trying to make a change in the world or their world.  That's what that's what it feels like if you if you are writing to young people to be optimistic in the book.  What are some of the frustrations that you understand on this side that may hinder that optimism? Because if a young person says, yeah, but the system right now is crumbling more and more, how do you how do you maintain that optimism or do you think there has to be a point where they go? I'm not optimistic. I'm just fighting to break what it is to create something new.  Part of the reason that it's 700 pages long is because by reading the book, they'll see men. There are a lot of structural problems or barriers in making this place better.  We're learning right now in Vivid, a vivid example of the fact that our democracy is not the way we would imagine it to be. But there are all kinds of elements to it where the most votes don't necessarily translate into the equivalent amount of power. Very popular proposals can wither on the vine because of a filibuster in the Senate. And so I don't try to gloss those over.  You know, the Paris accord did not solve climate change, but it created the first global framework whereby all countries agreed, we have to do something about this and here's a mechanism to do it. You can still be terrified about the pace at which we are burning up the planet and yet think that was a worthwhile endeavor because it gives us at least the opportunity maybe three, four or five years down the road to keep building on that. So that is the kind of mentality I want young people to have a certain impatience, a certain frustration, a certain anger about the status quo.  There are times now where, you know, you have younger activists criticizing me for Obama. Why don't you take care of this or that or the other? And I, I welcome them feeling frustrated and impatient because that's how I was before I got started. And then they'll get their own knocks on the head and, you know, some stuff won't work out exactly the way they want. But the impulse. Is the one that I want to encourage, because it's as a consequence of that, that constant striving and imagining something better, that things don't get exactly as we want it, but they get better.  You're a very serious person because, I mean, you're a president of the United States, but at the same time, you're a lot more fun than a lot of people think.  You know, I'm constantly trying to explain to people I'm a funny guy, but but I don't know. But you're right. But you really are. You really, really are. And what I liked in the book is there are moments where there's just like a roasting of people or life like the G20. I've never I've never heard of a world leader. Describe the G20 the way you do in the book. The high school of it all. I wanted on a personal level, have you maintained connections with those world leaders as like like do you do you send Angela Merkel means do you like who are you still close with just as a human being?  You know, I don't send Angela Merkel names, but I talk to her sometime. Sometimes, you know, she'll give me a call, I'll give her a call and we'll trade notes.

So I don't want to mention that, you know, that I'm giving them a call because I did get them in trouble. You mentioned something like an Angela Merkel look. You know, the stance she took in Europe relative to immigration. And the enormous political cost she paid for that, and yet there was something inside her that said, look, I'm not going to simply abandon a million people who are in desperate need.  You know, you see that in somebody and you say it, it encourages you that for all the cruelty and venality and corruption around the world, there are a lot of good people doing good work and some of them actually rise to significant positions of power. And in that sense, democracy can work the way it's supposed to. If. You know, we have a vigilant citizenry, and that's not always the case. You've started leadership programs not just in South Africa but all over the world.  The Obama Foundation has set about on a journey to inspire young people to grow up to become leaders growing up in South Africa. I was taught about the different levels of what a struggle is going to be. You know, the freedom fighters may not necessarily be the best politicians, the best politicians may not necessarily be the best leaders, the best activists may not be the best organizers and so on and so forth. Everyone has a role to play in trying to get to a certain place.  And so I wonder, when you set up these this leadership academy that's all over the globe, you know, you're clearly trying to create mini Obamas everywhere, which is probably like a fever dream of the right.

So the best I could come up with was to never glorify it, to never pretend like it isn't a dilemma. And so those kinds of questions, I think, are ones that."}]}

That's right. God uses doctors. I mean, not all doctors.  You know, Dr. Phil is the devil's work, but doctors who are actually doctors, well, they're doing the Lord's work and props to people like Dr. Fauci for speaking to black churches and for not doing that thing that white people do when they visit a black church where they stop talking like Martin Luther King Jr.. And I can tell you that we as a people will get to herd immunity. Hey, man, you can just use your normal voice. Oh, thank God.  Oh, my voice was killing me. And if you ask me, Black Church is the number one place to reach black people.  I mean, the only other place that would make sense is aversives on Instagram and a black barbershop. But that one wouldn't work because then they just get sidetracked debating which vaccine is the greatest of all time. Now, men, listen up. Polio is the greatest vaccine of all time. The hell it is, man. What about mumps? Mumps, man? Don't bring that mumps bullshit into my shop.  Look, the point is encouraging vaccinations through the church is a great idea. It's actually something that The Daily Show wants to get behind, which is why we asked Pastor Roy to help us out.  Thank you all for logging on to the Lord this morning. It has come to my attention that some of y'all are looking at the Colvert vaccine. The way Jesus looked at you was doing the Last Supper suspicious.  Look, I understand that the medical community has done unholy things to black people, but I'm here to tell you to put your trust in the trinity of Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson, because if you get Dorona, Jesus can't put his hands on you. He socialist's it. So I want you to let Jesus and that vaccine into your soul, well, at least to your left shoulder.  I don't think they'll hit me.  I said, I want you to let Jesus and that vaccine into your soul, helping somebody give me my soldiers.  That alone, I want you to baptize yourself in the healing waters of the vaccine.  You get your vaccine, get your team, push out the Antichrist and let in the antibodies. You want to bring the vaccine.  Might my this I want you vaccine atheist to believe your brother not be led astray by false prophets.  Don't bring these guys.  Let the vaccination be your salvation from your isolation.  Never going back, back, back, back, back, back.  Blessed would be immune for they shall inherit the earth from the movie theater to the gym all the way to the promised. The Red Lobster. Oh, yes. Nango whole up, I think we to make the point also, I got to wrap this up, my little boy got a clarinet lesson over Zoome. I only pay for the free 40 minute version. Praise Jesus and God bless Dr. Foushee. And I'll see you next week for the booster shot.  Oh, yes, I can feel it. All right. When we come back.  Don't say Sloan tells us why black women aren't as strong as you may think. And Andre is joining us as a guest.  Don't go away.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show, it's no secret that black women have always had to deal with negative stereotypes. But for Black History Month, Dorsay Sloan looks at a positive stereotype that still has a negative impact. In another episode of DeWall saying. Black women, we gave you Oprah, Beyonce and all your favorite reaction, me, I've heard people say they like their women, like they like their coffee, strong, black and hot enough to give you second degree burns.  Careful what you wish for, Dariusz. But the thing is, not all black women are strong and even the ones that are strong aren't just that we like doors open for us, too, especially with someone with biceps like Michael B. Jordan, abs like Michael Jordan, hair like Michael B. Jordan. But unfortunately, the strong black woman stereotype is ingrained in American culture. It has a long history about as old as Morgan Freeman and Betty White combined. Now, you may be wondering, what is a strong black woman?  Is the idea that black women are emotionally resilient, naturally selfless, too proud to ask for help and can succeed with no resources? So basically, every character played by Viola Davis, the irony is the strong black woman stereotype was started by black women to come back on the negative ones. See, in the aftermath of slavery, there were really only two stereotypes of black women. You were either some sex temptress Jezebel or a mammy who was just there to smother people in her boobs.  In response, black suffragette Mary Church, Terrell Point, the strong black woman model lifting as we climb. And I get what she was going for, but lift as we climb. Even bodybuilders don't do both. At the same time, you can expect the black woman to do more than Schwarzenegger in his prime. But over time, society shrank a black woman down to just her strength. And the popular conception now is that black women can bear and overcome any birth.  We see it all over our culture in movies like The Color Purple. All my life I don't fight. And how can we forget Ghost or Whoopi Goldberg literally has to let a white man use her body to rub foreheads with his fiancee. Even when black women only have one line, it's strong as hell or you will be moved. Damn, at least let her say hello. Let's all say what's wrong with being perceived as strong? Isn't it a good thing?  No, not if black women destroy their mental and physical health trying to live up to it. And not if people think black women are so strong, they make them do all the work on their own. Look at Stacey Abrams. She helped Democrats win Georgia. And before you knew what she was being asked to fix vaccine distribution, the New York subway and Carmen guys marry. The stereotype even reaches the doctor's office. Black women are less likely to be properly diagnosed.  They have a much higher maternal mortality rate and they're less likely to be believed about their symptoms and pain. So a black woman basically has to be a doctor to know everything that's going on with her body and then convince another doctor that that's what's happening. I was in a car accident. I have contusions, lacerations and internal bleeding. Get me a morphine drip and perhaps surgery step.  We'll get you a couple of bandaids. You'll be fine. What? So the next time you see a black woman struggling at work or trying to lift the box, help her, don't just stand there like you're about to see Wonder Woman in action. In fact, if you're in the New York area. Now, moving this week and I could use some help moving my couch, because I'll be damned if I'm going to pull my back lift in my own couch.  Thank you so much for that to say, I really wish I could help you move, but I'm busy on whatever day that is. All right. When we come back.

We talked about the legacy of Billie Holiday and her portrayal of the legend in her new movie that's just gotten her two Golden Globe nominations on today. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.  So what it is, isn't it? I enjoy it just as much as the regular Daily Show.  So thank you very much. I appreciate that. I really do. And before we get any further, let's start with the congratulations that are in order to Golden Globe nominations, which is huge for your work on the new Billie Holiday movie.  And what's really impressive about is not just the nominations. This is your debut acting role. I mean, what a way to start.  Yeah, definitely. What a way to start. And it was almost a way to end while I was on set like this. But this might have taken me out. I might have done this. But now I mean, now I'm definitely more balanced and I feel kind of at a healthier place. But yeah, it was I mean, I didn't want to do it at first, but I'm really glad that I did. And I didn't sort of, I guess, self sabotage my way out of it, because it's an honor to be a part of the story and legacy and to help bring the truth about her life to the public by Billie Holiday.  People might know as the musician, but what makes this film special is you show us Billie Holiday as the civil rights icon, as this woman who is fighting against a system that is trying to shut her down. Tell me a little bit more about that story and the part of her life that a lot of people really don't know about.  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, to put it frankly, is the part of her life that people were never supposed to know about. People need to understand that the reason they know Billie Holiday is this sort of tragic drug addict, but like a great jazz singer is because that was that was the narrative that was fed to us as a people. But what they really need to know is that she was sort of the genesis. She was the great grandmother of civil rights.  She's the first martyr in the war on drugs. And she was singing Strange Fruit, a song about lynching in America in defiance of the government. And she was integrated audiences. You know, she was a fighter and doing it all on her own. We did not have civil rights as we would have had if it wasn't for her, her sacrifice. So she's a hero.  She's a hero because she went up against arguably the most powerful force in the world at one time and maybe even now the United States government. You know, it's a really scary story.  Talk me through your role and what it was like for you to play this woman who on one hand is this amazing icon who's performing and and really enthralling audiences. And on the other hand, a woman who's dealing with her fears or insecurities and the dark world that she is a part of, whether she likes it or not.  Yeah, absolutely. And I love that you said that just now, whether she's a part of it or not, because one of the things I always say I hear all the time is that it was a very complicated it was nothing complicated about a black, queer woman trying to live free. It's complicated as the circumstance that she's in the 30s, 40s and 50s. The entire government is using all of their force. And as you said, one of the most powerful forces and one of the most powerful figures and one of probably the most diabolical and divisive.  But you know him, Harry Anslinger, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the entire article was singing a song about racial terror and that she lost her father to Jim Crow, that she was raped and punished for being raped by a 40 year old man sent into a brothel, was raised in a brothel, you know, that was pumped into the community. She used that as a way to deal with the trauma of living. So it was nothing complex about her.  She was beautiful. She was in very good shape and love her. And it was. Sense of urgency, right, performing this role and singing when I was on your show and when I was doing it in the past, it was to pay the bills and to pay people and to just bring this song into a new era. But on set, it was very different. And it was first time I sang the song and realized this is not a song.  This is another song with this song, Bulging Eyes, The Twisted Mouth Burning Flesh. And I had a need for people in the audience to stop enjoying it. I didn't want them clapping. I didn't write. This is not the song. Go do something because I might die to sing this tonight. So it was definitely transformed.  You could have taken the easy route in playing the role that you did, but you didn't. I mean, you lost almost, what, 40 pounds to play this role. You also took on some of Billy's vices. You started smoking. You don't smoke. You surrounded yourself with people who are struggling with drugs as well to understand addiction, to start to to sort of understand what she was going through, what was the hardest part of inhabiting that side of Billie Holiday's world?  I mean, the hardest part. Listen, it took a toll on my family, right? Because the reality is when you're going through this and you're preparing for it, you're not going through it by yourself. So on my family, on my own, my company staff, on my band, you know, everybody. Yes, studying the addiction lost weight to the drinking and smoking and and all the things as well, too. I don't typically they're not for me.  I make personal vow to be abstinent for the last seven, almost seven years. So that's not a sign that I engage in either. And so it was definitely. Challenging, but I think the hardest part when I look back on it now was coming out of it as a normal human being, three years of life and trying to figure out. I am in this season of my life and, wow, really, really difficult, and I remember a moment actually on set, he would ask me, he says, you were doing this on all of me."}]}

You cannot even understand. I'm excited because this is a concept that I have been preaching to my friends and anyone who's within earshot of me for like the last five, six, seven years of my life. But I do not have the time nor the commitment to do any of the research to back up any of my claims.  And my claims are simple. Number one, I believe that racism costs everyone, especially white people, a lot of money and it costs all of society money. And I've always said to people that racism is one of the craziest concepts to me because it causes the people who oftentimes harbor the belief to hurt themselves. So I welcome you to the show because you've done the work behind this. You've actually done the data science behind it, and you've written a book entitled The Some of US.  Tell me a little bit about what the book is about and why that title is so important.  I wrote this book because after nearly 20 years of trying to find solutions to economic inequality and our big problems in society, I kept running up against a wall and I kept asking myself, OK, why can't we just seem to have nice things, nice things? I don't mean like hovercraft or laundry that does itself. I mean universal health care, a public health system to handle pandemics, reliable modern infrastructure in a country with so much wealth. So I set off on this journey across the country.  I immersed myself in the research and it turns out that racism is at the core of all of our most vexing public problems.  As I've traveled throughout the world, the countries where they have the most ideas are the countries where they also have the most homogenous populations, where they believe everyone should have because everyone is like me. It feels like it is easier for people to not believe that life is a zero sum game when they think that everybody is benefiting because everybody should benefit. Talk me through some of that and what you discovered in your research.  That's exactly right. The book is called The Sum of US, because at its core, when we say racism, it's the worldview that our society is a zero sum game, that progress for people of color has to come at the expense of white people. A dollar in our pocket has to mean a dollar less and theirs. And of course, economically, that's just not true. Just last year, Citigroup found that over the past 20 years, the racial economic divides which are here because of policy, past and present, cost this country 16 trillion dollars.  But I kept hearing it across the country when I talk to people. I went to Mississippi and talked to a factory worker named Joey who explained that his white co-workers voted no to join a union that would have given them better wages and benefits, because the mentality was, as he said, if they're blacks or for it, I'm against it. That has been the overarching ideology and worldview of many, if not most white Americans. According to the public opinion data, really, particularly since the civil rights movement sort of forced them to share the spoils of a country that used to be basically the benefits were for whites only.  You know, you you run think tanks and you've worked in the world of just looking at the numbers before this book. You combine the numbers with the personal stories. What have you found is the best method to get a person to understand that racism is costing them money, even though they're the one being racist?  You know, it calls to mind a visit I had with a woman named Bridget. This is a white woman who spent her whole life working in fast food. She lives in Kansas City and she totally had bought the US versus them zero sum anti immigrant, anti, you know, people in the inner city story. And because of that, I think in many ways she actually did believe that she, herself a minimum wage worker, was ever going to be worth more than seven twenty five an hour.  But she was approached by workers who are organizing with the fight for fifteen, fifteen dollars an hour. And she went to the first organizing meeting. She saw a Latina woman stand up and describe her like her bad plumbing, her apartment, having three kids and feeling trapped. And she said, I saw myself in her. And Bridget came to realize that it wasn't a zero sum game, as she says, you know, black, white or brown.  It's not us versus them for me to come up. You've got to come up to she said, as long as we're divided, we're conquered. And that movement, the racial fight for 15, has been unlocking what I began to call the solidarity dividend. These gains we can achieve, but only when we link arms together across race, higher wages, cleaner air, better funded schools for everyone in America.  One of the things that intrigued me the most because it was similar to South Africa was. The story of the public swimming pools is even up stand up, it's about this where I would say, you know, racism is such a powerful drug that it would make white people drain swimming pools. The thing that they loved more than anything, they decimated them. You've used this as the central unit, like the throughline to the book and the telling of the story while public pools the perfect example of how racism hurts the people who oftentimes the most racist.  I went to Montgomery, Alabama, where there's this park in the middle of the town called Oak Park, and it used to have one of the nearly 2000 grand resort style public swimming pools that were built in the 20s, 30s and 40s at a time when it was just one little symbol of a big government commitment to everyone having a high quality of life. This was when the sort of American dream really set took root. The swimming pool was public. It was funded with tax dollars, and yet it was segregated.  During the civil rights movement, black families said, Hey, what about us? And instead of integrating it, the town of Montgomery closed the swimming pool, drained the public pool back, did it back to truck full of dirt, filled it and actually closed the entire Parks and Recreation Department wherever they even sold off the animals in the zoo. And they kept it closed for a decade, the entire nineteen sixties. It's wild. It's wild, but it is the perfect example of the way that racism has a cost for everyone.  It feels like in America, ever since the civil rights movement, we've all been sort of dealing with living in the bottom of a drained pool, it feels like since then. And the evidence bears this out. We have seen white people with their votes turn their backs on the formula that created the great middle class that makes would have made all of our lives better because they would have to share it with people they've been taught. And that's the key that they've been taught to disdain and distrust.  You know what I what I also enjoyed about the book is that you lay out the possibilities, you lay out the conversations that need to be had and you lay out the economic benefits of it all. Before I let you go, one of the more interesting things that you that you propose is having some sort of Truth and reconciliation commission where people talk about these things. Now, as a South African, I saw the benefits and I've also seen the shortcomings of not doing something post the conversation.  So walk me through why you think America would benefit from having some sort of truth and reconciliation commission.  So we have a country the United States was born with this view of a zero sum racial hierarchy built into the economic justification for stolen land, stolen people and stolen labor. This is a very old idea. And yet we've never gotten on the same page about our history. So I think it's not possible for us to actually move forward if we're still contesting the basic facts about our history and even our present. So obviously, we have to have a sort of truth effort, but it can't just be a commission in Washington.  What's so exciting to me is that it's happening at the community level. You've got to take action, but you also have to start with telling the truth. And that's what's been robbed from us. Aren't truth in this country is so much more terrible, but also because of the overcoming so much more beautiful than we've been allowed to truly know.  While hopefully reading your book will be the first journey on that first part of that journey, rather, because I think it's insightful, it's wonderful. It is optimistic, but it's also truthful at the same time. Heather McGhee, thank you so much for taking the time and congratulations on a fantastic book.  Thank you, Trevor. Thank you so much.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about Marjorie Taylor Greene Faces Backlash | Jeremy O. Harris."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The whole of slave play is about love. It's about how couples love each other. It's about how people love each other. It's about how families, how friends love each other and how race either adds a complexity or an added dynamic to that love. Was that a big part of it? Or why was love so crucial for you? Because when you were watching the play, at no point do you think that any of those white people does not love the black people that they were interacting with.  You don't even not like them. You understand that everybody is being subject to the system.  Well, I mean, it's because I mean, I grew up in the south, right. And so in the south, there are certain things that are like very plain spoken. And that's why I like the South, because, like in the South, I had friends who I knew for a fact like like adored me. I don't know, love was what happened, but they adored me. They were obsessed with me. But they'd be in a car in there and we'd be on the carpool.  We'd be talking about Pok\u00e9mon or whatever we're talking about. Their dad would start whistling Dixie in the carpool. This is a real story. And they would whistle along. And I didn't know what Winn-Dixie was. But then I learned the song and I come home and then I'd sing the song to my mom, which you do. And that's that's a racist song. What are you talking about, Mark? And then I'm like, you go back and you tell them that's racist.  I'll go back. I tell them, Andre. Oh, my God. You know, my my grandma, my grandpappy did fight for the Confederacy and I guess I am a little bit racist. I'm sorry that made you feel weird. Anyway, go on. When I moved north, I would be in situations with hyper ambitious other like students, many of whom are white, who would say things or do things that were based on race or race and race.  So they'd be like, well, Jeremy might be one of the smartest people here, but, you know, he got in because, like, the reason he could get in, right. Because he's black or the reason it's like no one knows my S.A.T. scores are like which I'm sure I'll test you, you know, but like things, little things.  And then when you say, like, that's racist, like, no, it's funny. I learned I learned this from Tina Fey or I learned this from, you know, all these jokes that, you know, the in the mid two thousand years and everyone felt safe. Comedy Central, NBC, all these places were like built up around liberal comedians saying like racist things that made black and brown people feel weird. They were told they couldn't because they were they all voted for Obama.  And so I started to think a lot about how the most insidious form of racism is a kind of racism that we see perpetrated by people that like in their voting, that are liberals who like vote against policies that young, black and brown people. And so I became really obsessed with this sort of entanglement. Right. Sort of like entailment that is based around mutual respect, mutual love, but like where in that respect is hampered by being blind to the ways in which being socialized white has like a challenge, has made it almost impossible for you to understand the complexities of any anybody that's not your own.  I really do appreciate how you've created a conversation that is honest, that is heartbreaking. That is funny. As funny as shit, man, it's one of the funniest things you ever watch. And it leaves people, in my opinion, walking out, going, man, I see the world in a slightly different way and I see the way I participate in the world in a slightly different way. And so, yeah, I would add even more nominations to year 12.  I can talk to you for hours, but maybe maybe we'll catch up on another day. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for being here. And thank you for creating Jeremy. I appreciate you. Can I just say one thing before we go? Of course. We have to get the thing that the thing that I really want to say is that if we really want more people to see this right, we want as many people as possible to see this.  We have to think about the fact that in America, theater is on its last legs. All of the arts are on their last legs. I want everyone to look into Banaz Hero and the work that they are doing and also to research the Federal Theatre Project and the Federal Arts Project, which was one of FDR like plans instead of the New Deal where you made federal one and put money into the hands of artists not just in New York, not just on Broadway, but everywhere, because the multiple billions of dollars that arts bring to the economy are necessary.  And I know it's fun to think about theatre as like that bad musical your son or daughter was in that you like through. But like, you know, theatre is what made fleabag is what made I destroy you is what helped make the the foundational principles of all of the shows you watch on Netflix, Hulu. Yes. All of these other places. And if you want to make sure that there's a new generation of people who are still able to do that, who didn't starve while they were trying to do that, please, please, please ask your representatives to bail them out, bill all of them out, because, like, I'm a lucky artist, I'm fine.  I'm sitting in like a gorgeous apartment right now. But there are plenty of people who are my peers, plenty of people who are above me, who are inspirations to me, who are struggling to figure out how they're going to get their next meal. Because we've thought more about Wall Street bailouts. We've thought about the art sector bailouts and those are important. They feed our soul and they also help reshape how we think about America in significant ways.  We'll make sure we do that then. Thank you, man. Don't be a stranger. Look after yourself. I won't. I won't. Thanks. All right.  Thanks again, Jeremy. Now, in case you're wondering, Jeremy himself has created a collection of plays by black writers called the Golden Collection for more information about the Golden Collection, including how to buy its, please check out the link below. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this.  I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and it could happen here. And boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.  The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show, the pandemic recession has hit many people hard, but it's hit one group especially hard.  The Zelenik has more.  The covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the U.S. economy with millions out of work and much like underwire and micro bleeding, it's disproportionately hurting women. Economist Olga Starkloff told me why.  February twenty twenty, about two and a half million women left the workforce. Two and a half million. That's right, 80 percent of net job losses.  Wow. Even when it comes to unemployment, women are overachieving. For decades, women have been chipping away at the glass ceiling, joining the labor force in greater numbers with each year until the pandemic, which has reduced the percentage of working women to 1988 levels. The question is, why is this happening?  Well, my interview with Dr. Darshana Mahalingam provided one compelling reason why the pandemic is one of the reasons that I just needed to step back from my research.  We lost child care for several months before I can.  I couldn't quite hear there was a bit of a background. That's my three year old son with a Lego train car. Sorry, hold. I know it's my I think it's my background. And that's the trash bin. There better not be any new jobs in there. There were Ninjago sent there thanks to school closures and child care disruptions, mothers are stepping back from the workforce in large numbers and not because they want to.  I think we really need to move away from this idea of personal choice. If you have to choose between bringing home a paycheck to feed your family and, you know, avoiding a deadly disease, that's not a choice. No, it's it's not.  And it doesn't matter if you're young, old, black, white or that slick bitch in the next apartment that keeps eyeing my husband. This affects you.  My research has been focused on infectious disease and incarcerated populations. And so they were looking at sort of how can we improve testing and support for these individuals who are very vulnerable to getting infected.  So you were researching covid and you had to take a step back?  Yeah, I mean, it was a very difficult decision, I think, of all that you could have accomplished in this past year if you had full time covid safe child care. Like I know for me, I just know I would have been able to finish my one woman show from home. Hamilton my whole life is in this room where it happens, this room where it happens, this room where it happens.  Yeah, art is important.  So millions of women have just spent a year stuck at home workshopping our dream projects with our kids instead of with audiences or producers. And much like a stoned Elon Musk tweet, this could affect the whole economy.  Women leaving the workforce means that these women are now losing the skills that they have and becoming less productive. And so that could affect actually the entire economy and economic growth for years to come. Even women who are still working are experiencing sort of hidden burdens that are doing the dual role.  They know, no, you can't have a snack, you just can't have a snack.  They have to work and at the same time take care of their children. And so there are also mental health repercussions. Something's got to give. Hey, babe, can you give us that? No, he can't.  No, he can't have a snack. So how do we fix this before moms across America just lose it asking for a friend.  I know you can't. Yeah. You know what? Have a snack, have a snack, have all the snacks. Dr Chertkov says it's going to take a lot of work.  covid-19 highlighted and exacerbated longstanding structural gender and racial and ethnic gaps that need to be addressed. And not to mention women I think have learned it.  Yes. Oh my goodness. You want me to Google? We're looking up a Pok\u00e9mon Collo. We did my other new piece, the level area of expertise. So where was I? If we would like to see things get better, we need institutions, policymakers to pay attention to child care and expand access to child care. Shoot.  I had a question off of that. I'm actually sorry. Maybe my producer Sarah, the women have it.  I definitely have it here. I remember that question. Yeah, sorry.  Yeah. You got your hands full. It's OK. Oh OK.  I come prepared and mommy's working.  Well, one thing is certain. The pandemic has shown us that the system is broken and women need institutional support. Something has to be done probably by someone who doesn't have kids at home.  Thank you so much for that, Daisy. All right, when we come back, I'm going to be talking to Dr. Carl Hart, an Ivy League professor, about why he uses drugs.  You don't want to miss it.

Earlier today, I spoke to Dr. Carl Hotz. He's a professor of psychology at Columbia University, an Air Force veteran and a recreational heroin user. We talked about that and his new book where he explains what the real problem with drugs is. Dr. Cohort's, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you for having me. Trevor, good to see you again. You have a new book out that's got everybody talking drug use for grown ups. Now, just to set the stage, you are a tenured professor at Columbia. Right? You are. And you're an established and respected neuroscientist. You are not some dude who's just, like, selling Banky like little baggies of weed or this is like we're talking to a doctor here. First things first.  Things first. What is the biggest misconception around drug use, because when people say, like drug use for grown ups, people won't be like, wait, you're talking like Vicodin. What do you mean by drug use? Yeah.  So when I'm talking about drug use, I'm talking about the fun drugs that people take, cocaine, MDMA, psilocybin. And the biggest misconception is that most people who use these drugs are addicted. The vast majority of people who use drugs are not addicted. 70, 80 percent of those people who use drugs don't have problems like addiction. They are responsible individuals. They go to work. They take care of their families. They pay their taxes, responsible people.  They are professionals. And that's one of the reasons that I wrote the book.  So to clear up some of those misconceptions, you speak from experience. I mean, I remember how shocked people were when you said, oh, I use heroin. Everyone was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What?  Yes. So let's let's talk about that for a second. So I. I acknowledge the heroin use, cocaine use, MDMA use. I acknowledge all this drug use in order to dramatize the fact that most people who use these drugs are not addicted. So I wanted people to see somebody who's responsible and somebody who writes books, somebody who meets their obligations so they can understand that. See, we've been misled. Instead, they say they don't want to believe that.  But one of the major concerns, when we think about the drug and selves, let's think about a drug like fentanyl. Fentanyl has been approved in the United States in medicine since 1960. So we use fentanyl in medicine safely.  Not a problem. But when you think about somebody like Prince, for example, he died in part because he had fentanyl in a drug in a pill that he thought was oxycodone, Percocet. He didn't know fentanyl is a lot more potent than OxyContin. So if you put the same amount that you take of OxyContin, then you take that same amount of fentanyl can kill a person. And so if Prince knew what was in his drug, he might still be with us today.  So in the book, I'm arguing we need to regulate these things. We need to make sure we have drug checking facilities so people will know what's in their substance. So it decreases the likelihood of them dying from ignorance, not knowing what's in their substance.  If somebody is addicted to cigarettes, is that as bad as being addicted to crack or the effects of certain drugs, not worse than other drugs in the addiction? Yes.  So let's think about that.  We can think about people who are addicted to alcohol and then if they abruptly discontinue the alcohol use, they can die. The same sort of thing is less likely with something like heroin. So alcohol withdrawal can kill people. So when we think about the severity of addiction, alcohol is one of the sort of worse.  But we managed to deal with that, OK, in our society, although we still lose people every year from alcohol withdrawal.  But the point is, is that it's an important point here is the if the majority of people who use any drug are not addicted, it tells you that you have to look beyond the drug itself. There are other factors that are important for drug addiction, other factors like psychosocial factors, psychiatric factors like people who are who have co-occurrence. Psychiatric illnesses are far more likely to be addicted to drugs and somebody who doesn't. So it tells us as a society, we have to be better.  We have to treat people better. We have to do better. We have to make sure we have social safety nets. All of these things will radically decrease the amount of addiction of addiction that we see in a society. But when we focus on a drug, then we're not focusing on the most important aspects of addiction.  What terrifies me, though, on a completely uninformed level, I look at the stories, I go, man, Whitney Houston and then DMX. I read in the news DMX and they go, like, what happened? And he he's in a coma and like, it's because of drugs. And then I go, man, Dr. Hotz, I. I mean, I'm all for, you know, people legalizing drugs, but I don't want to keep losing people.  Is that is that something that I'm missing when I think like that? Yeah.  Let's let's think about Whitney. Oftentimes you see the headline she was she had cocaine in her system and it probably had nothing to do with her death. She died in a bathtub because she fell asleep.  She also had an histamines in our systems, which you can get over the counter. She had benzodiazepines in her system that she was prescribed. She fell asleep in the tub. So if anything, you know, you want her to be awake. Cocaine keeps people awake. And so people need to understand that the headlines are often wrong. Let's think about DMX. I don't know what happened with DMX yet. We don't know. But there are people who are speculating and it would be nice to know, but that's why I would try to get the right information out.  So if there was a drug in. And he may have hidden what he was doing because it's stigmatized. We hope people come out of the shadows and they can seek help or they can seek information about doing the activity more safely so we don't lose people.  If you said to me six years ago, hey, Trevor, we'd should it be legal or not be like that is the devil. People are going to smoke the weed and it's a gateway drug and it's going to kill them all because that's what I was brought up to believe in my school, in my community, in my life. Now I look and I go like, man, I was an idiot. I can't believe I even thought that. So how are we all so wrong?  How do we all become programmed incorrectly then?  Well, so the first thing people have to understand is in the United States, drugs are not banned because of pharmacology or science. Drugs are banned because of racism. We banned all of these drugs originally because of their association with despised group, the opioids we banned because of our hate of the of Asian Chinese folks, cocaine, because of our hate of black people, marijuana, because I hate Mexican Americans and black people. And so we understand why drugs are banned in the first place.  Then we can start to look behind the curtain and see some of the what the reality really is. Like you said, with marijuana, you can no longer fool people because more than 50 percent of adults have used marijuana in their life. So it's harder to fool them. But with something like cocaine or crack, it's still easy to fool people. Most people haven't used that drug. It's still easy to fool people about heroin because most people haven't tried heroin.  And so as we increase the number of users with these drugs, it becomes more difficult to fool people. Or when you have people like me and other scientists who speak up, it will become less likely that we mislead the public.  But you have to remember, Trever, there is a lot of money in misleading the public about drugs in science and law enforcement, all of these sort of industries that have been around prisons. So there's a lot of money in this. People have to know and remember that drug trafficking, the illegal drug trafficking business is a multibillion dollar industry and that industry is supported primarily by middle class and upper class people, white people."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about The GameStop Uprising."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something like ninety five percent of all stocks are owned by the richest five percent. And, you know, if you guys aren't ready, they're really not going to change that fundamental fact.  So full of people who are on it's, you know, for the people who came in because they liked that, you know, that GameStop got a new CEO. You know, those people who who actually wanted to invest, the people who said, I believe in a future or screw the hedge funds, what position will they? And now, I mean, are they at risk of losing a lot of money now or are they in a position where they've made so much from the initial investment that if they get out, they're generally going to be fine?  Yeah, I think you're going to exit a position. You just can't start a new one, which is somewhat reasonable. OK, but, you know, I think some some people are going to really lose a lot of money if people who are sensible enough sold into this rally. You know, if you bought it at 50 or 100 and sold it three hundred or three hundred and fifty, you're doing pretty nicely. But just looking at the the the chart for trading in GameStop today, it was, you know, went from.  Like three hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty, you know, during the course of the day, it's been an utterly crazy, wild ride, none, none of it making much sense at all. Now, I think a lot of people, however, are going to hold onto their positions hoping that, well, if it went to three fifty, it can go to a thousand. On Twitter today, somebody said to me, 4000 with, you know, eight or ten rocket emojis afterwards.  This is the nature of bubbles. You know, this larger issue here is that the entire stock market is in an epic bubble. I mean, it really one of the great bubbles of all time. The market has only been valued this highly at a couple of previous times in history for 2000, at the peak of the dotcom bubble and 1929 before the great crash. So, you know, where it's really crazy territory and things like this are a sign that maybe things are just a little frothy.  But, you know, I think there is that sense that when people get people who are new to the market, get this deeply involved as kind of a sign that things are are ripening, shall we say. There's a saying in Wall Street that a bear market is when money returns to its rightful owners. And I think, you know, I don't know what's going to set off that bear market. Bubbles always go further than you think they could.  There's certainly no rationality to this at all. But at some point, somebody is going to be left holding a very depleted bag.  Before I let you go, does the person who is holding the depleted bag determine how the situation is dealt with? So if the big players on Wall Street, if they're the ones holding the depleted bag, is it going to be dealt with differently from the government versus if, like the people on the ground are holding the depleted bag? Oh, absolutely.  There's nothing right now that we can see that would require any kind of government bailout. A couple of hedge funds may blow up, but nobody cares. There's no systemic risk around that. You know, much the worse for them.  But, you know, I think if some Wall Street people left, left, left, left, holding the bag, there may be some bail out if you know larger entities than just a few hedge funds got into trouble, we'll have a government bailout. That's always what happens. Wall Street's quite an amazing game there. It's always this that every 10, 15 years they seem to run into a wall and the government bailed them out. So, you know, they learn that they can get away with anything.  There's a famous story about Sonny Barger, the old Hells Angel who woke up from a coma after a motorcycle accident. And the nurse said to him, well, I hope you learned your lesson. Mr. Barger said, yes, I did. She said, what's that?  He said, I can do anything and survive to that. Wall Street cultivates. They can do anything to survive. The only thing that would really change anything is if there enough popular outrage that said, we really need to regulate this casino. Seriously, we didn't really have that serious set of reforms after the 2008 financial crisis. Right. You know. All right. But not serious. It was not like the reforms that happened after twenty nine to thirty two.  So maybe, maybe, maybe if we see some kind of very serious mash up, we might finally wake up and have some kind of regulation of this business.  And that would.

The GameStop uprising, the biggest thing to happen with video games since Solich got busted for doping, but if you haven't heard the news, what happened was that some Wall Street hedge funds bets a lot of money that the stock price of the video game store GameStop would fall. But a bunch of people on Reddit found out about those bets. So they started buying GameStop shares so that the price would go up and the hedge funds would lose a lot of money and lose a lot of money they did in the billions of dollars.  So as you can imagine, Wall Street is pretty unhappy with those Reddit investors.  A handful of industry leaders are calling for an investigation because of the angry mob that's formed against them.  Last week was a free market. It was a free for all market, no doubt about it.  For my twenty five years in the business, I've never seen this form of collusion on such a widespread fashion. This type of behavior is not the behavior that you want to be replicating. I think there is something obviously wrong, and it's the gamification of Wall Street.  Talk to an analyst this morning, guys, who said this is dangerous. They forget they're buying a stock and a piece of a company.  It's not just some symbol that you play hot potato with it just because you throw the Hail Mary pass in your back yard and it's caught for the touchdown in the wind. Doesn't mean you're Tom Brady.  What's going through my mind is how irrelevant I feel and how every day I just don't want to get out of bed and how it's the least amount of fun I think I've ever had. Oh, man.  These Wall Street guys are taking this so hard that the interviews are just turning into therapy sessions.  I feel so irrelevant right now and I'm not having any fun. And I just remembered my parents never hung my paintings on the refrigerator.  But the truth is, what the Redskins did here is nothing new. In fact, the only thing that makes this so unique is that this is just the first time that the little guy has used the big guys tactics against him, because when it comes to manipulating the market and treating trades like a game, no one is better at it than Wall Street. I mean, they do this shit all the time. In fact, let's take a look at a few examples, starting with a scam one big bank pulled just a few years ago.  The New York Times reporting over the weekend that Goldman Sachs is running a scheme to artificially inflate aluminum prices.  An aluminum warehouse controlled by Goldman Sachs holds the equivalent of a quarter of the annual North American demand for the metal, but only offloads or distributes a required minimum of three thousand tons a day. No more, no less. Whatever the demand is pushing prices of the metal higher even as demand is declined. Goldman profits from this practice two ways.  First, from the extended rents paid to store the metal, and second, by the bets made on aluminum futures by its trading arm.  The inflated aluminum pricing by Goldman and other financial players has cost American consumers five billion dollars over the last four years. Yeah, that's right.  Basically, Goldman Sachs manipulated the supply of aluminum by only letting out a little bit at a time. You know, the same way Daniel Day Lewis limits the supply of movies isn't I mean, the dude's only been in six movies over the past twenty years. The Rock made that many movies yesterday. Get to work.  Danny, by the way, for the rest of the segment, I'm going to be pronouncing its aluminum, even though the correct pronunciation is aluminium. But we had a vote and all the people I work with our American. And so they won and I didn't want to accept the election result. But then I was like, no, we don't do that again. And I'm sorry, guys, but aluminum should never be hoarded. It needs to be used the way God intended to make condoms for robots or for lingerie.  Taylor Green to wear as a hat. And believe it or not, Goldman Sachs got away with the scheme for years until people caught onto it.  So I guess you could say that their aluminum plan was foiled.  Wow.  Brown, brown, brown. Now, as crazy as this is, it's actually a common tactic with Wall Street.  You take over a market and then manipulated supply to drive up the price, like how JPMorgan Morgan used its control over electricity to fund these California JPMorgan Chase accused of manipulating energy prices and so driving up the electric bills of millions of Americans at night when energy prices are very low, essentially, they would bid them up so that in the morning the companies would go to buy energy and find the prices artificially high. It takes a few hours to get a power plant going.  So they would have to buy the energy in the morning when it was very, very expensive. In one case, JPMorgan duped California utilities into paying nine hundred ninety nine dollars per megawatt hour when the going rate was only twelve dollars.  Yo, this shit is crazy. It's like these guys were sitting around a table like I'm tired of just abusing our power metaphorically. Let's do it for real. Basically because of JPMorgan, the cost of electricity. Went up from 12 dollars per megawatt to almost a thousand dollars per megawatt, even Omeish people were like, yo, I don't even know what electricity is, but that shit is messed up. I hope the Amish community doesn't come off to me on Twitter for that one.  I mean, at that price, I would actually be less upset if you jumped me and robbed me. At least then it feels like you had to work for it. And the truth is, people, this isn't something hedge fund people are ashamed of. In fact, some of them even brag about it on the TV.  Jim Cramer once made a fortune running a successful hedge fund. He went on to host his own TV show, Mad Money, that offers stock tips to investors. But as Cramer has found out lately, a lot of Americans are mad at him. This video, made in 2006, has suddenly gone viral. Cramer explains to his own financial website, The Street Dotcom, how he could influence stock prices up and down as the manager of a massive hedge fund.  You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money, but it's a fun game and it's a lucrative game. And I would encourage anyone who's in the hedge fund game to do it because it's legal and it is a very quick way to make money and very satisfying.  By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that, but I hear these people got no shame, no shame, zero, nada, zilch. He's just out here boasting about his evil plans. I mean, the only people who do that are hedge fund guys and bond villains. I mean, listen to him, listen to him talk about it. It's legal and it's very satisfying. Just as a general rule, whenever you have to remind someone that something is legal, it's probably shady.  You know, no one's ever like, hey, Trevor, you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory? It's legal. But when it comes to hurting people in order to make a buck, nothing compares to the Great Recession of 2008, which was caused by guess who?  Wall Street manipulating the markets during the hot housing market, banks took millions of home mortgages, many held by people who could not afford them and bundled them into packages as mortgage securities. JP Morgan today admitted that it sold those packages to investors, even though its executives knew that many of the mortgages were highly suspect. When the market collapsed, those packages became mostly worthless.  Goldman sold investors subprime mortgage packages, but then made its own bet those same investments would lose value without telling investors. Goldman employees themselves use profanity to disparage the deals.  Boy, that Timberwolf was one deal.  And when asked if any of the executives at least felt partly responsible for the financial collapse, there's things that we wish we could have done better in hindsight or even regret.  Regret to me means something that you feel like you did wrong. And I don't have that.  When you hear your own employees or read about those in the emails, you feel anything? I, I think that's very unfortunate to have on e-mail. Are you embarrassed and and very unfortunate. I don't have emails and please don't take that feeling that way. I think it's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that.  God damn even the crowd. Do you see them? Even the crowd in the chamber was like, oh, you know how bad you have to screw things up to turn a Senate hearing into a Jerry Springer taping. But this is how you know, how psychotic these guys are. Not only did they tank the economy, but they talk about emotions like they're serial killers. Do you regret hurting these people? Regret is a thing that one feels when one has done something wrong.  I mean, how can you expect these guys to change their behavior when they can't even express their remorse? The closest Wall Street comes to reflecting is doing Coke off of a mirror. So after all the damage Wall Street has done to people's lives, please miss me with all of this whining about how unfair it is for Reddit to boost GameStop. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all these guys are heroes, but I will say it has been fun watching how some of the people who got rich off of GameStop have been spending their money.  While GameStop has minted plenty of millionaires, many retail investors are using their more modest profits to pay bills.  When Reddit user even posting that he paid off his student loan debt thanks to the money he's made off of GameStop the last few days.  A ten year old Jaden Carr. Two years ago, his mom bought him 10 shares of GameStop as a Kwanzaa gift. Back then, they were six dollars each. Now he sold them for more than three thousand dollars. What are you going to do with the money that you've made on GameStop?  I am already saying two thousand two hundred fifty thousand.  The best hunter can cashed in on the GameStop phenomenon last week, but didn't just cash in for himself."}]}

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Let's talk about America's new president, Joseph Rafiki. Biden, there's no doubt that he's got a tough job ahead of him. But in his inauguration speech last week, Biden made clear what his top priority is.  To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy.  Unity, unity, unity, unity, unity, unity, unity. Unity. Unity. Unity. Unity, but look, I get it. America has been divided over the last four years. Technically, 12, if you include Obama's years, actually it was pretty divided on the Bush and Clinton who. Yeah, that was bad. Oh, you said the 60s and the civil war. I mean, the Civil War. Oh, man. You know, it also wasn't great.  Whole thing with the pilgrims and the Indians either. All right. So America has been divided for like two thousand years now. The point is unity.  So I can see why unity would be very appealing for people right now.  But for unity to work, you have to agree on what unity is. And in Washington right now, they're not even united on that.  US Senator John Cornyn from Texas. His response to the inclusion of transgender people in the military was to tweet another unifying move by the new administration. Questionmark.  Democrats claim to want to unify the country, but impeaching a former president, a private citizen, is the antithesis of unity.  Joe Biden, you talk about unifying the country, pursuing impeachment after he leaves the office or further divide the country.  It's hard to unify when you're impeaching a president who's already left office. Joe Biden vowed that his top priority was, quote, unity. Does anyone at this point still believe him? Anybody raise your hand at home, raise your hand at home?  Dude, only one of your viewers is dumb enough to think that you can see him through the TV because this is ridiculous. All right.  Apparently, Republicans think that unity means the Democrats have to act like Republicans.  That's not what unity is. Unity does not mean agreements. It doesn't mean doing whatever the other side wants. Unity means the state of being united and united means unified and unified means to be in for the same thing and thing. Same thing means I'll tell you this much unity doesn't mean you just do what the losers want, right? It definitely doesn't mean that you can't hold Trump accountable for what he did that wouldn't fly in court.  You are accused of manslaughter. How do you plead? I plead unity, Your Honor.  Man, get your ass to jail. And it's one thing to try to find unity with people who disagree with you on policies. But how do you find unity with people who don't even recognize your legitimacy?  A clear majority of House Republicans who are now going to bring about unity voted to overturn the election and in effect, make Trump president for four more years over the will of the voters.  This election was not stolen. Do you accept that fact? Well, what I would say is that the debate over whether or not there was fraud should occur. We never had any presentation in court when we actually looked at the evidence.  Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor, Green, Kuhnen supporter, she has repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians. Twenty nineteen. She liked the comment that said, quote, A bullet to the head would be quicker to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in twenty eighteen. She said, quote, The stage is being set after someone asked whether they could hang President Obama and Hillary Clinton.  Holy shit. This Marjorie Taylor green lady wanted to shoot Pelosi and hang Obama and Hillary. This woman is something else. It's like a normal.  Karen fell into a vat of chemicals and then became a Batman villain. I mean, how can you achieve unity with someone who's literally wanting you dead? There's a reason why planet Earth never ends with a bill being signed.  And suddenly the challenges at the young are eager to reach a bipartisan agreement. Seriously, people forget the country for a minute, right? That's their co-worker. Imagine going into work every day knowing one of your coworkers wants to kill you. A coworker stole my yogurt one time and I still hold it against him. I was hungry for twenty minutes that day.  Kevin, you're a monster. Look, considering where the Republican Party is right now, I don't know if the two sides can really come together, but it would be fun watching them try to talk their issues out today.  We're here to work on unity. Now, this is a safe space to share your feelings and hopefully find some common ground. Democrats, let's start with you. What does unity mean to you?  We want unity. You know, it's about coming together and respecting each other.  Wrong are Republicans. You had a very strong reaction to that. What does unity mean to you?  Unity is bringing everyone in the country together to do exactly what we want all the time. And if you have a problem with that, we'll storm your office, that's what unity is. Very good sharing. I love how honest you're being Democrats. Is that something you think you might be open to?  No. He just said he wants to storm my office or put you in prison.  What are your options? Very good. Very good. You know what? I feel we should have a bigger say. We won the election. You stole the election.  Now, remember compromise. OK, so how about Democrats won the election by stealing it? Yeah, that's fair.  No, it's not.  Look, we just want the Republicans to come to the table in good faith and find areas we can agree on so we can pass meaningful laws.  OK, let's explore this. Republicans, when Democrats just said that, what is it that you hear?  I heard that they want mandatory Sharia socialism and to put Rupal in the fifty dollar bill. That's what she said.  That's not what I said at all. Although I am open to the Rupal thing, I gather the money.  But listen, if they really wanted unity, how do they explain the capital riots?  That could have been a real moment for unity. But there wasn't a single Democrat in that mob because they're all talk with no insurrection.  They say, see, this is what he does. It's always my fault. It isn't your fault. It's your fault every single time. Why did you make it OK?  You're walking around like it's not my fault if you get stuck and you stop, especially the Democrats.  Look, we're almost out of time.  So what I'd like to do is just take a step back and look at all the progress we've made. Excuse me.  Progress. There has been no progress. See, you finally agreed on something. You're both united behind the fact that you can never unite unity achieved Republicans, your care Democrats. Let's pick this up again next week.  We have a lot to work through because I got to run. I'm parked in a handicapped spot. So thanks for she did, of course.  All right. When we come back, the star poet from the inauguration, Amanda Gorman, is joining us on the show.  Don't go away. I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and it could happen here. And boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.  The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. So earlier today, I spoke with poet, activist and author Amanda Gorman. We talked about what it was like being the youngest inaugural poet in history and what lies in store.  If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade. But in all of the bridges we've made, that is the promise to glade the hill we climb. If only we dare it, because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It's the past we step into and how we repair it.  Amanda Goldman, welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you so much for having me. I'm super excited. I'm the one who should be excited because, I mean, twenty twenty one kicked off with a bang. It's been a whirlwind for everybody. But I think for you more than most people, it has been extra whirlwind, which is a word I trademarked.  You can use one day if you'd like to add one of your poems, you you went from not just being notable because you read a poem, the youngest ever inaugural poet, but also because of what the poem meant to people, because of the inspiration behind it, because of how people felt after they heard what you did. What has it been like for you just just in this little period since the inauguration? What is your world been like?  My world has been crazy. I mean, it's been turned upside down. I mean, when I was writing the poem, I knew it was a historic moment. I knew it was an important moment, which is why I wanted to do just service. But I wasn't really paying attention to the ways in which my own personal life might change. So I went I did my job a poem. I walked off and just kind of expected everything to be the same.  And then I remember trying to open my Instagram just to look at other people's posts in all of my apps and just crashed because of all the followers that were just flocking to my channel. So it's been amazing and I'm still kind of absorbing it all like a sponge.  The poem The Hill We Climb wasn't just momentous because of the day it was performed on. I think what made it so special was that you incorporated up until that day the things that so many people were feeling about America. If you don't mind, walk me through why you felt it was important to write a poem for that moment and then even still be writing the poem on the actual day that you were delivering it.  Right, exactly. Well, for me, I mean, I was writing it and trying to find a way to encapsulate what had gone on over the past four years and even looking more expansively than that. And then, you know, we had the interaction at the capital. So for me, it was trying to say we've had this reminder of the ways in which democracy is both fragile and also enduring and how it is to defend it. And I think a lot of times in cultures, we think of the ways in which we can cleanse ourselves with water.  I think of the ways that we can cleanse ourselves with words, meaning that was an opportunity to kind of we sanctify, we purify and reclaim not just the capital building, but American democracy and what it stands for, a pretty high ask of myself. But, you know, that's what I do when I showed up and I rolled up my sleeves and that was the aim of the poem to use words to try to go back to the quintessence of what America can be.  I think you achieve that. I think you achieve that a thousand times over. And it showed in how people responded. I mean, consider it from this perspective and you may not, but this is how I saw it. I went on a day when Joe Biden's inaugurated. Kamala Harris is stepping into the role as VP. Lady Gaga is performing. Jennifer Lopez is performing. You were the thing that people would look at. You were you were the trending thing.  I mean, it was like you competing with like Bernie Sanders is was basically it. That must be. Do you take a moment to go like, man, this is surreal.  That is so surreal, especially because my friends there are so funny and, you know, they come for blood. So they were texting me like, well, Joe Biden did a good job opening up for Amanda Gorman. You know who won that? I'm not racist. It's not a competition. It's not a fight over who wins the inauguration. They're like, but you did. And so I think for me, it was so daunting to be on a stage.  You know, there's Michelle Obama to my right and Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and what have been so the figures that have been mythologized for me and to find myself not only being in that space, but owning it and claiming it was, I think, the highlight of my career.  I believe that you are slated to perform at the Super Bowl. That is correct, yes. I didn't understand. You understand the juxtaposition of this right now.  Write poetry at the Super Bowl. You understand the levels you've made it to where they would like this person is so good that we have to bring her to do poetry at the Super Bowl.  Right. We believe that went over my head because I knew about the Super Bowl and the inauguration around. The same time, and it was like there was not space in my head for like I kept being like I got to write that inauguration poem and my team was like, there's this little thing called the Super Bowl, which you should also keep in mind. And so, you know, it's very rare."}]}

It's stuff you should know dotcom or wherever books are sold.  Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. So earlier today, I spoke with Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Evan Osnos. We talked about the election and what kind of President Joe Biden could be. Evan Osnos, good to see you again, too.  Nice to see you.  Yeah, it feels like the last time I saw you, I was 30 something years old and now I'm fifty two, but I only aged in one night. How are you doing.  I'm one hundred and twelve actually, but holding up ok. Thank you. Holding up really well. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Thanks for having me.  You are a Pulitzer Prize winning author. You are a journalist. You are somebody who has spent a lot of time living the life of Joe Biden through the lens of your work as this moment unfolds. How do you think Joe Biden is situated to help the country recover from what is going to be arguably one of the most tumultuous elections in history?  Well, in a strange way, he's had a lot of practice of a certain kind for this. And it's terrible practice. I mean, if we know anything about Joe Biden, we know that he has been through some really wretched things in his life. After all, we know is remember his late wife, nearly a hunter, his daughter, Naomi, they died in a car accident when he was just twenty nine. And then later his son Beau died of a brain tumor.  And I mention that partly because I think in politics, sometimes we're sort of a little cynical about things like that. We think that it's kind of being used as a prop. And what I find fascinating from looking into his life is seeing the way that it really altered him. It changed him. I mean, just being acquainted with suffering in quite that way, in that very personal way resonates with the condition we're in as a country. We are literally suffering.  We're literally grieving. And so he knows something of that.  If Joe Biden is to win the election, he's going to be in an interesting position where it looks like Republicans will still have the Senate, Democrats will have the House. And so now in many ways, his selling point is going to be tested.  Can Joe Biden be the person who brings the sides together to get things done for America, even though no president, incoming president, if that's what he is, would ever ask to preside over a country is divided as he is. The truth is he actually has some experience in these moments to give you one example, when they came in in 2009, one of the first things he did was he started lobbying the late Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania to change parties, go from being a Republican to a Democrat.  He was also given an assignment. The Obama administration said, all right, Joe Biden, we want you to call up members of Senate, try to get them to vote for the stimulus bill. So we did that. We started working the phones. He's kind of constantly on the phones with people on Capitol Hill and he got people that got three votes. And those turned out to be the three votes that ended up being decisive in passing that bill.  So in a way, if he was a boxer, you would say that he's kind of comfortable in the clutch, like right up close. That's that's his that's his happy place.  As strange as it may sound, once once Obama took office and once the Tea Party took its hold of the Republican Party and then Trump, and by extension, there's no denying that politics has changed dramatically. Do you think he'll still have the same pull and sway with the Republicans to get them to do it? Or do you think that he's now just going to be facing if he wins again, four years of just being blocked by Mitch McConnell and the Senate crew?  I think, look, we'd be insane not to worry about that. That's the reality. That's the lay of the land. It's certainly the politics we inhabit right now. I think there's something interesting that we sometimes lose sight of, which is that it matters the posture with which a president sells the policy, meaning if they're selling it from the middle, strangely enough, you can actually sometimes sell things that you can't sell if you're coming at it from a distinctly progressive direction or a hard line conservative direction.  I mean, in fact, some progressive analysts have done some survey work. And what they find is that people in America might go for more aggressive climate change legislation if it's being presented to them as job growth or building a sustainable economy rather than, look, this is a moral obligation to future generations.  You've written extensively about Biden. You've also written extensively about China. This is going to be one of the biggest challenges that America faces going forward. Where do you think Biden begins? Because he's had he's had some tough rhetoric on China, but you can't deny that America needs the relationship with China. It's been set up in such a way that they need it. So, like, what does what does he do and how do you see that relationship unfolding?  Well, for one thing, I think, frankly, China is going to be a little sorry to see Donald Trump go, because even though Donald Trump sort of uses a lot of language of confrontation, he has sort of efficiently undermined American credibility in the eyes of the world. There was a recent study that showed that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin now have higher favorability than Donald Trump. So from China's perspective, Joe Biden is actually a little bit more of a problem.  He's kind of like a recognizable form of a president and diplomat. So I think what you're likely to see is that Biden will probably actually hold on to some of this confrontational stuff that the Biden that the Trump administration has done, because it makes it easier, it gives him leverage. But what he'll do that's completely different is he'll do it with allies. He'll do it in the concert of American allies in Europe and in Asia rather than America first, which often meant that we were doing things alone.  Do you think Biden will be able to sell himself as that guy? Because, I mean, one of the big differences between Trump and really any US president has been that Trump knows how to sell his achievements, whether they exist or not. Joe Biden seems to be the kind of person who says, well, read my record, check what I did. And people like we don't read Joe. We don't read. That's not the world we live in.  Do you think that he will be able to rebuild some of the bridges that have been broken down in many of these industrial areas that he used to have such a strong base?  Well, I mean, it is true that he is kind of like stubbornly attached to the reality based universe. He seems to think that is consequential and that he has to respond to that. We know there are millions of Americans who just voted for Donald Trump. It wasn't a fluke this time. They knew what they were doing and what he's going to do. I think his basic strategy is he said to me, and he has said to others is if you begin from the principle that I am listening, I'm listening to you in a real way, you'd be surprised what the effect might have on our political chemistry.  Look, that's an optimistic take, but he doesn't have any option. It's better than going in there and saying, I'm giving up on half of you because you didn't vote for me.  When you look at the journey that America faces, the next American president would face if it would be Joe Biden, would you say that his personal loss and the tragedies that he's faced put him in a position to be the best leader to lead America out of one of its greatest tragedies, which has been the pandemic?  I do. I think in a curious way, this life of ups and downs that he's had of failures in some cases of embarrassment and then of great successes has primed him to fit into where we are as a country. Because let's be frank, we've had our ups and downs lately. And if we are now talking more candidly also about our whole history and the ways in which we have not treated people the way we should, and I think he's at a moment now where we are coming to terms with a little bit more of a humbler notion of what it means to be Americans, both at home and in the world.  And he's a bit of a humbler person than he was when he got into the Senate some hundred and fifty years ago. So I think he really is coming at this from the position of recognizing our strengths and our limitations. And that's better. Probably than coming at it with an imagined idea of what we are and that we're going to make ourselves something we never really were.  Evan, thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you for joining us today. And hopefully I'll see you again soon. My pleasure. Thanks, Trevor. Thank you so much, Evan.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about Biden Calls for Unity | Amanda Gorman."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And I want to say, you know, it's not an exciting possibility that a poet will be at something like the Super Bowl.  It's just nothing I have heard about before. And so the moments I strive for in my lifetime, which is to bring poetry into the spaces that we least expect it so that we can fully kind of grapple with the ways in which it can heal and kind of resurrect us.  Let's talk a little bit about poetry. I mean, it feels like poetry, like some art forms has it has its highs and then it has moments where it disappears. Why do you think we should never forget poetry? What is it about poetry that you feel society needs to hold on to?  Well, what I always say is poetry stands as a great reminder of the past that we stand on in the future that we stand for. I do not think it is any coincidence that when America seeks to kind of consecrate its ideals, it does so through poetry. I don't think it's systems that we see a poem at the base of the Statue of Liberty as opposed to like a scientific formula or even a prosaic paragraph. Why is it that we call forth poetry in those moments or even point out to students, when you're at a Black Lives Matter march and you see banners that say they buried us but they didn't know recedes, that's poetry at the racial justice movement.  And so poetry, because it's inherently rebellious in its nature, I think it really becomes the language and the rhetoric of the people we get to kind of co-opt it and play on it. And what's more, we get to use those words to realize our thoughts and transform those thoughts into action.  You have a journey ahead of you that I think nobody can predict, which is exciting. And you've had a journey that has been unpredictable. You you talked about it growing up in a family with a single mom who was raising yourself and your twin sister and your brother as well, and and how you just fought to achieve. My question to you then is what are you aspiring to seeing that you've basically done it all? I mean, in the past few weeks?  That's a great question. I mean, I'm really taking that time to kind of sit back and think and be like, well, wow, that was it. Kind of what's next? And for me, I don't think it's about kind of beating my last thing or even competing against myself. I hear that a lot. And that's fine for other people. I'm not necessarily fighting against myself or competing or contesting against anything I've done, but I want to keep on the trajectory that I've started for myself.  I never want to kind of dally or diverge from that. And for me, that just means using my poetry to touch and heal and impact as many people as possible. And that can be at the inauguration and the Super Bowl. It can be in a living room. It's often in classrooms and other students. And so that's what's next for me on the more like resum\u00e9 tick thing that I always have to mention when I'm on talk shows and like, I have three books coming out.  So there's also what I need to write. But, you know, I'm just chugging forward.  I know everyone's going to be reading the books. Thank you so much, Amanda Goodman, and congratulations on all your success.  Thank you so much. Don't forget Amanda's books, The Hill We Climb Changed Things and her poetry collection are all available to preorder right now. All right. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this.  Lancaster, South Carolina, is in the middle of not much, but growing up nearby. I knew it as the hometown of a black man named Jim Duncan, who became a Super Bowl hero after the 15th. Now, my new podcasts return man. I'll discover that his death still makes no sense at all.  The story was that my brother went to the police station, took a gun off a police officer and shot himself in the head. Most people don't believe that.

I'm Trevor Noah and this is the daily social distancing show today as February the 10th, which means Valentine's Day is now only four days away, people. So if you have someone special in your life that you've spent every single minute with this past year, this is another day to do more of that. Anyway, on tonight's show, your water is trying to kill you. Why would you celebrate America's greatest black spies?  And we catch up on the biggest impeachment trial in 12 months. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah. Here's a. Let's kick things off with water, a.k.a. lazy seltzer. We all drink water every day, but recently in Florida, someone tried to turn the water into a weapon.  Now to a shocking case of computer hacking in Pinellas County, Florida. Investigators are trying to hunt down the person who tried to poison a public water supply remotely.  The plant operator monitoring the water plant in the Tampa Bay city of Oldsmar noticed computer breaches starting at about eight a.m. Friday morning.  The hacker was controlling the computer systems mouse and was able to increase the level of sodium hydroxide in the water supply from about 100 parts per million to more than 11000 parts per million.  This is obviously a significant and potentially dangerous increase. Sodium hydroxide, also known as Y, is the main ingredient in liquid drain cleaners.  If ingested in large amounts, sodium hydroxide can cause vomiting, chest and abdominal pain. Fortunately, a plant operator immediately reduced the levels back to what was safe.  OK, this is insane. A hacker was this close to poisoning the water supply of a county in Florida. I mean, luckily, it wouldn't have worked anyway, you know, since Floridians don't even drink water, they get all the hydration they need from Red Bull and whatever this is.  States like Blue, but not only was this hacking evil, it was also just lazy. You want to poison the water supply, you roll your ass out of bed and pee in the reservoir like they did in the good old days. Lazy ass hacking bitch. And by the way, is it just me or was with the computer for Florida's water system even lets you pump that much sodium hydroxide into the water supply? Like, I mean, forget the hackers.  Should the computer even have an option to poison the entire county, at least make it so you have to click on all the squares with streetlights first. Moving on to some international news out of New Zealand, Australia's Hawaii. In addition to being a full size recreation of Middle Earth, New Zealand is also a real country with its own government.  And yesterday, a meeting of parliament broke out into a fight over what it really means to show respect.  One member of the New Zealand parliament was ejected because he was not wearing a tie with weary t. The co leader of the country's Maori Party was asked to leave the chambers on Tuesday. It's all because of a time mandate for male lawmakers. And Waititi was wearing a traditional green stone necklace that he says is a nod to his native people.  You can clearly see this is the city's business attire. As far as I'm concerned, that is not part of my culture ties, and it's forcing the indigenous peoples into wearing what I described as a colonial lease. Yes, thank you. This guy is so right, nobody should have to wear a tie. They should have zero purpose. That's why instead of wearing a tie, I just wrap up fruit by the foot around my neck. If I'm going to be uncomfortable, I'm at least going to get my snack on.  Also, why would you want to make this man wear a tie? Ties were invented so that boring guys could try and look more interesting. Oh, look, I have a thing around my neck. This man has those amazing traditional tattoos. He doesn't need to be more interesting with a thing. You don't want to distract from that with a lame ass tie. It's like making the rock with mom jeans. And look, I get that in the past, necktie served a very important purpose that we used to point to a guy's penis.  But it's twenty, twenty one. We figured out where the penis is. We can get rid of the arrows. Now if you ask me, ties are more trouble than they're worth. Why do you think there's always those creepy guys at the office?  Because their ties are choking them just a little bit all day long and then like, oh, I'm being choked as a sex time. It must be sex time. Why else would I be choked? Thais are so dumb that even colonizes couldn't get people on board with them. You need to accept Jesus as your Lord and savior. OK, I guess heaven sounds cool. And now I will take your land and I will sleep with your wife. Well, I mean, you've got the guns, so what can I say?  And also you must take this ribbon wrap. It's around your neck and suffocate yourself to look professional. Nigar, you out of your mind. And finally, news from the world of sports. Ever since Colin Kaepernick began kneeling for the national anthem, professional teams have been grappling with how to handle all the drama around that moment. You've got fans who want to stand. You've got players who want to kneel, people trying to signal the big guy while also keeping their hand over their hearts.  But now one NBA team has tried to find a completely different solution.  If you go to a Dallas Mavericks game now, you will not hear or be able to stand for the national anthem because they're not playing it any more. They're not singing it anymore. The Dallas Mavericks have ceased playing the national anthem before home games this season and do not plan to play it moving forward, a decision made by the owner, Mark Cuban. The Mavericks did not publicize the anthem's removal. This from Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas.  The decision to cancel our national anthem for the Dallas Mavericks is a slap in the face to every American and an embarrassment to Texas. Sell the franchise and some Texas Patriot will buy it. We are the land of the free and home of the brave.  That's right. This is the land of the free. Why aren't we forcing people to sing the national anthem?  All right, look, people, I know that this is a big tradition in the US, but just so you know, the rest of the world thinks that it's really strange that America sings the anthem at their domestic sports games. Like in other countries, you only sing the national anthems at international sporting events. You don't do it for every game. That's like saying grace before tasting every free ice cream sample at the ice cream shop. And can I try the vanilla, please, for what we're about to receive?  May the Lord make us.  Can I try the chocolate to third-rate by taste?  I mean, just think about it. What is the national anthem even have to do with the basketball game? George Washington didn't beat the Redcoats in a game of three on three. I mean, although he would have won six two in the seventeen hundreds back then he was basically Sheck in a powdered wig.  No we're going to fruit is going to bowl. We're going to look now.  After the story broke, the NBA forced the Mavericks to start playing the anthem again, which Mark Cuban probably isn't too happy about. So luckily for Mark Cuban, though, I have a solution that Mark Cuban is so going to love.  No, Mark, you recently ditched the national anthem, and I get it after literally thousands of years, this song comes with a lot of baggage. We need a fresh start. That's why I came up with a new national anthem that I think you'll enjoy. I'll listen.  OK, here goes a little bit of Kansas in my life, a little bit of Florida by my side earlier. Little bit of Utah is what I need. A little bit of Georgia as what I see a little bit and OK. And then and then it goes into a cool response spot.  When I say us, you say a US. US. Anyway, that goes on for like six or seven minutes and then we get to the climax, the big finish now, you know, America is a country on the.  Sir, unless you're screwing with us, it makes no sense whatsoever. You are so for. Oh, OK, well, while I'm here, I also invented an iPad, but for dogs, I call it the I'm poor, I'm out. Thank you for your time.  All right, let's move on now to our main story, the second impeachment of Donald Trump and shout out to my boy Trump over there for getting impeached more times than Mike Pence has had sex. I see you, player. Today was day two of the trial. And we're going to catch you up on all of the latest developments in the return of our classic segment from one year ago, the magical, wonderful road to impeachment.  When you go to the beach, that's probably presidential harassment.  Today, the Democrats began laying out their case for why President Trump should be held responsible for inciting the capital riots of January 6th. And between Trump's many speeches, interviews and tweets, the prosecutors had a mountain of evidence at their disposal. It's basically a slam dunk case. I mean, this would be like having a murder suspect who left his DNA at the scene, dropped a bloody glove and fled the scene in a Ford Bronco. There would be no way you couldn't convict that guy.  It would be a weight that happened. Now, in addition to the evidence against Trump, prosecutors showed heroin never before seen footage of the attack on the capital and the violence inflicted on Capitol Police. So we all expected the Democrats to present a competent, compelling case. But what nobody expected was that Trump's lawyers would be so terrible they never addressed key issues. They went off on meandering tangents. One guy cried while reading a poem. It was going so badly for the Republicans.  I thought Ted Cruz was going to start another insurrection just to change the subject. In fact, when Trump's lawyers were done, some of the harshest criticism came from Republican senators on their own team.  Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's biggest allies, saying, I thought I would figure out where he was going, but in the end, I don't know where he was going. Senator Susan Collins said, I was perplexed by that first lawyer who seemed to not make any arguments at all.  The first lawyer just rambled on and on and on and didn't really address the constitutional argument.  President Trump's team were disorganized. They did everything they could but to talk about the question at hand and when they talked about it, they kind of glided over it almost as if they were embarrassed of their arguments. Now, I'm an impartial juror and one side is doing a great job and the other side's doing a terrible job on the issue at hand as an impartial juror. I'm going to vote for the side that did the good job. Why do you think the Trump defense team did a terrible.  Did you listen to it? I did. OK, it speaks for itself.  God damn Bill haters. Dad is pissed and I would be to Trump's lawyers was so bad they forced him to be impartial. Nobody should be forced to have an open mind. Seriously, though, do you know how bad a job those lawyers had to do that even Lindsey Graham turned on them? He wants to be on their side. That's like drawing something so bad that your kindergarten teacher roast you for it. It's OK, Billy. You know, I want to like this, but this is dog shit, my man.  This doesn't look like a flower at all. In fact, I got to show this to the kids. Everybody come together. Yeah. We got this bitch ass flower that Billy drew. Oh, my God, you're so dumb. Now, of course, nobody was more upset by Trump's shitty lawyers than the man who was never going to pay them anyway.  Donald J. Trump.  Sources familiar with Mr. Trump's reaction told CBS News he was angry with his lawyers lackluster performance, which at times rambled on at one point, nearly yelling at his television while Bruce Castor was making his case.  That's right. Trump was reportedly yelling at the TV while watching his shitty lawyers make their opening arguments. Although, to be fair, Trump also yells at the TV during commercials. Good luck with your boner, Mr. Baggara. We're all rooting for you. Those four hours, you're going to be so much fun. But still, this is bad news for Trump's lawyers because Trump is a dude who will spend four hours at a rally ranking his favorite department store.  If he thinks you're rambling, then you know you fucked up. Luckily for these lawyers, we all know and they know that no matter how bad their defense is, they're still going to win this trial, which on the one hand makes a mockery of the entire idea of accountability. But on the other hand, it's going to make for a very inspiring movie.  To defend his impeachment, President Trump needed the best legal team in the country.  Instead, he got these guys. My name is Bruce Castor. I am the lead prosecutor, lead counsel for the 44th president, United States. They were to hope this lawyers who didn't prepare barely tried and may not even have law degrees. The president was nearly yelling at his TV while he was watching the proceedings. I worked in this building 40 years ago. I got lost then and I still do.  But they're about to find out that what matters is it the strength of your case? It's having a defendant whose party won't convict him no matter what. I'm ready to move on.  I'm ready to end the impeachment trial because I think is blatantly unconstitutional simply beyond the constitutional authority of a Senate. President Trump is going to be acquitted.  It's the impeachment trial. Critics are calling a sad moment for democracy. And the founders worst nightmare, underdog lawyers, a story of triumph against no odds that words are what make our Constitution. Frankly, they sure do. All right.

Hi, this is Bill Clinton. Please join me on my podcast. Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this for conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know? We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future. Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  My name is Rita Kaye. I am Ellen Bernstein Brodsky. This is your grandmother. What's the matter with you?  Well, and it is a podcast about the relationship between grandmothers and grandchildren, as my mother would have said, TACA, who wouldn't have wanted a Jewish grandmother?  Sometimes she accidentally live streams. We're like, who's going to tell her?  I'm just hearing about this now. Let's you to call your grandmother on the, I hope, radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  The stock markets, America's number one supplier of great depressions, as volatile as the stock market can be. This has been one of its wildest weeks yet craziest business story out there.  And Internet trading mob is driving GameStop shares higher, it appears, despite short sellers. Look at the stock. It's up more than six hundred eighty percent so far this year.  They realized that all of the institutional investors were hedging on GameStop. So they just bought a bunch of call options, bought a bunch of stock and created the a squeeze that you saw on Friday.  OK, OK. I don't know about you, but that explanation is way too complicated. Short selling the thing of the long selling and the look.  What we really need here is that scene from the Big Short where Margot Robbie breaks it down for us in the bathtub, you know, and I actually called her to do that, but she blocked my number. So I had to figure out plan B.  But basically there's a group of people on Reddit who don't use the stock market to invest. They use it to gamble. And yeah, that's what a lot of serious investors do to put these guys on Reddit a more honest about it. And they love to troll the people who aren't. So there's a store called GameStop that sells video games. Not a great business to be in. Such games can be downloaded now, which is why the serious investors decided to short GameStop, which means to bet against it.  But the creditors are gamers who have a semi ironic love for the store. So they started making names encouraging each other to punish the serious people by buying worthless GameStop stocks. Now, instead of failing, GameStop is succeeding wildly.  Not really. Of course not as a business. But come on, stocks are never real.  The serious people have already lost five billion dollars and some giant hedge funds have gone bankrupt.  Got it. Good.  Now let's get out Mogel Robi's bathroom before she gets home and asks me what I'm doing here. The last time she called me here was a bit awkward.  OK, now that we're on the same page, yo this shit is wild and I know some people are freaking out about this. People like this isn't how Wall Street is supposed to work. What's going to happen to these poor hedge funds?  Let me tell you something. Wall Street is going to be fine. All right? There are millions of people who are out of work and thousands of businesses closing. And yet the stock market is an all time high. No worried about hedge fund guys. They can cry about this from their helicopter that takes them to their boat. That takes them to their yachts.  In fact, if anything, I think it's actually funny to see how Wall Street doesn't like it when somebody's Wall Street to them. Yeah, because when they make moves that cost people their homes, people in Wall Street are like, hey, man, those are the rules. But when it happens to them, like, those aren't the rules.  The one going to regulate this and these Redit investors already moving beyond GameStop.  Now they're pumping up the stock prices of other failing companies like Bed, Bath and Beyond, AMC movie theaters and even Tootsie Rolls, which, by the way, I didn't even know that Tootsie Roll had its own stock. Who was that for? So it's a candy that looks and tastes like a turd, but it also sticks to your teeth. You're interested in investing. Now, if you think about it, the only reason that these Raddatz's have been able to pull this off is because of the Internet.  Yep. Think about it like Reddit and all these social media. They make it possible to get together with people who think like you. This wasn't possible decades ago. Like now, if you want to take down a hedge fund, you can find people to help you do it. If you want to plan an insurrection, you can find people to help you do it. So if you think you're the only person in the world who's attracted to that part of a stapler, that looks like a face.  Well, I'll see you at hot stapler faces dot com, my friend.  Mm mm mm. The GameStop stock explosion, you know, it's the reason your 14 year old cousin just bought a Ferrari, traders on Reddit sent the stock soaring this week, causing billions in losses for the hedge funds that bet against the video game retailer's stock. And today, Wall Street decided enough was enough. And this is a Fox News alert.  Now draw your attention to Main Street, where GameStop and AMC shares have been tumbling and trading action today as a growing number of firms move to halt trading on some stocks boosted by amateur traders on Reddit. The action is so wild that TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have restricted trading of these stocks. Wells Fargo also banning its advisors from telling clients to buy or sell GameStop and AMC.  Now, the criticism centered on Robert for abandoning their followers here in favor of helping those who had shorted all these stocks in the first place.  I don't particularly like the move on Robin Hood today. I'm talking to people this morning that say, OK, that is anticapitalism, you can't do that. A class action complaint was just filed in the southern district of New York against Robin Hood. And this is what part of it says, and I'm quoting purposefully, willfully and knowingly, Robin Hood, remove the stock GME GameStop from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise. Thereby it goes on manipulating the open market.  Yeah, that's right, people. Wall Street was getting rocked so hard by average people buying stock in GameStop that they just stopped average people from buying it. Yeah, the same guys, the same guys who are always like the markets must never be regulated. They must always remain free.  Those same guys are now like, oh, shit, the poor people got a hold of the freedom to turn it off, turn off the freedom.  So thanks to this ban, the GameStop stock that a lot of people bought for a ton of money is now worth a lot less, which is probably familiar to anyone who sold a used game back to GameStop. So right now, a lot of people are understandably upset about what Wall Street is doing.  In fact, it's bringing together people from all sides.  I mean, Ailsa and Ted Cruz are as far apart as Madison and Austin, and even they're both blasting the Robinhood app for blocking users from buying GameStop stocks. Everyone's mad. Even people like Yahoo! Jaru who tweeted, Yo, this is a good grab. What Robin Hood is doing, do not sell. And let me tell you something. When the guy who did the fire festival thinks that you're a fraud man and you're doing some shady shit.  Last week, you probably remember day traders on read it shocked the markets by driving stocks in GameStop, an AMC movie theaters higher than the Queen's here in Britain. But now Reddit has its eye on something even more shiny.  The GameStop saga continues to grow. It's not just stocks anymore, though. Reddit users are buying up silver, pushing up the value of the precious metal. Silver has now hit a five month high at nearly 30 bucks an ounce. That Redit group says that they're doing it because big banks, specifically JP Morgan Chase, have been, quote, suppressing metals for a long time.  Over the weekend, retail sites that sell silver coins and silver bars said that they were getting hit by unprecedented demand and they couldn't meet the demand.  It's been incredible. Pretty much physical silver. It's almost all gone in terms of life inventory.  We typically have about a thousand silver products in inventory available for purchase. We're getting so cleaned out right now that we're actually, last I checked, down to about 80 items in stock, which is a number I've never seen before and never thought we would ever see. The entire industry is frankly wiped out in terms of actually finding live silver that you can purchase and receive today. It's becoming impossible.  Oh, haemorrhaged Chaitanya. Oh, that's right, people.  Now, silver prices are skyrocketing, which is going to cause confusion at the next Olympics. I mean, if silver is more valuable than gold, everyone's going to try and get second place.  Sprinters will be at the finish line like after you met FDR, but after, you know, you always going first. But I'm always going first. You go ahead of me. Why don't you go ahead of me and this time you can go first.  Right now, while some Reddit users say that driving silver prices higher will cripple banks like JP Morgan, others claim that this movement is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms because it would help the banks. And I believe this because, of course, Wall Street will do that when Wall Street sees a scam going, it doesn't try to stop it. It tries to join in. If Wall Street caught you, robbing its mom would be like, hey, hey, I don't want to take off our shoes.  Sometimes she has cash in there. Get in there. Let me get in there with.  It's coordinated by the banks themselves a lot. The fact is the credit surge is now spreading from game stock to silver to all sorts of stocks.  And one of our correspondents has a pitch for where it should go next. Are you a creditor looking to stick it to the hedge funds? Well, forget about GameStop and Silver.  You got to invest in Kiwi's. I'm delighted. And Kiwis are the investment opportunity that Wall Street doesn't want you to know about their portable. They hold their intrinsic value. And it's easy to think you're ordering ten from Amazon and miraculously wind up with ten crates.  Here's a fact. As far as we know, every single hedge fund is shorting Kiwis. And are we going to let them do that to America's national fruit? I don't think so. But if we all buy Kiwis, then rocket ship and Kiwis are more than an investment.  They go great in fruit salads. They can be organic, track nuts, and they're the only fruit covered in fur. So if you ever wonder what it's like to take a bite out of a hamster, now you can with Kiwis.  And the best part is you don't even have to go through those Wall Street fat cats to get your Kiwi's, just call me and let me know how many you want, whether five or five thousand.  But this opportunity will not last forever.  Got maybe two days tops before it smells so bad in here that my landlord kicks me out. So order now. And remember, the more Kiwis we all buy, the more the hedge funds suffer.  It's just economics. So called today.  Please, honey, what did you do? I'm handling it.  Doug Henwood, welcome to the daily social distancing show here. Good to be here. From a distance. Yes. Yes, indeed. And it's it's a perfect time for you to be happy. You have really established yourself as somebody who is not just aware of the market and participates in the market, but also calls Wall Street out for what it really is. The biggest story right now is GameStop, Wall Street hedge funds and just a lot of money that is no way and yet everywhere in the shortest way possible.  How would you break this down to somebody who had no idea what was going on?  Most people, most civilians who don't really know the markets very well have the sense that it's all a big racket, kind of ludicrous, not that different from the casino, like all this image that Wall Street likes to cultivate about itself, that it's rational and it's at allocating capital efficiency and all that efficiently and all that. It's just nonsense. It's not doing any of those things. It does a little of it. But mostly it's just a game to try to outwit your competitors and people on the other side of a trade, whatever, and run away with the most money.  It's just there's nothing terribly rational. It's driven by emotions and psychology and fear. And most recently, over the last year or so, by a gusher of something like three trillion dollars in Federal Reserve money, which is been power, the market. So it's that sense that a lot of people have that this is all a bit of a racket is completely accurate.  So it seems like like you're saying, it's like basically people came into the casino and said, we're going to play against the house and we're going to make a lot of money. What's interesting here is a market that is oftentimes termed free and capitalistic has now been stopped. Can you explain that element? Why why was why was it stopped? Have these people broken the rules? Have they have they done anything wrong?  Well, I think there are a couple of things going on. One is these predators, they're just the wrong kind of people, but they're playing the same game that Wall Street does and they're getting together, talking up a stock, talking down a stock, trying to figure out the other guy's positions, looking who's weak, attacking them. They do Wall Street professionals do that sort of thing all the time. And I think it's very funny to hear their professions of outrage that this is just not moral.  You know, it's not fair. It's like the markets are supposed to be, you know, on the up and up and these guys are not playing fair. That's just utter nonsense. They're just the wrong kind of people. But I think the other thing is. Yeah, are they just trying to protect their own?  And Robin Hood a little likes to present itself as the democratic institutions and democratic broker for the masses are going to overturn the Wall Street order.  It's deeply plugged into the Wall Street establishment. That's how they make their money. They feed their orders to establish brokers who then make money on those trades by taking a little a little bit of the price.  So I think they are trying to make the market, but they're also trying to keep the fences up, make sure the ruble can't crash the party.  So then two questions. One, what does this tell us about Wall Street and the market and to what do we do to improve this? Because it feels like an unfair system.  It is an unfair system. It's a deeply unfair system. And one of the things that make me suspicious about all this talk of democratizing the stock market is that the distribution of income and wealth is very undemocratic. And there's nothing that you can do about that, nothing that a trading platform can do to change any of that. I mean, the fundamentals of the society are not going to change because some people in red, it got to play in the stock market.  But what does it tell you about Wall Street? It is largely of little economic significance. The standard story is that the stock market exists to raise money for productive corporations, to invest in capital equipment, buildings, hire people, do R&D.  It does almost none of that. The market really is more about extracting value from companies.  For shareholders. It's it really is a machine for extracting value. For the top one percent of society, the ownership of stocks is extremely concentrated."}]}

The officers found nothing in the car until turning their body cameras off when the cameras came back on. And officer is seen squatting by the driver's side of the suspect's car, apparently unaware that he's being recorded. He then stands up and steps back. About 30 seconds pass. Another officer approaches the car. That officer then squats down and pulls out a bag of drugs.  You know, I'm starting to wonder if the entire drug business in Baltimore is just cops buying drugs to plant them. That's all it seems like is like cops coming up to dealers like, hey, man, I need some evidence, man. And you've got some good evidence. Drug dealers like, nah, man, I'm out. Oh, then what's this? Wait, what just happened? I guess you just made a sale. Like as disturbing as these videos are, black people have known about police planting evidence for years, but nobody believed them.  But now there's the technology to prove it. It's sort of like how we've all assumed the hotel room was covered in semen. But then they invented the black light.  And we were like, oh, this is a thorough coating, even the ceiling. Watson it's on the black line. How does that even happen? Now, look, I know I know the two videos, it doesn't prove a systemic problem in policing that Stanford University's job.  Researchers at Stanford University collected and analyzed 60 million state patrol stops in 20 states. They found black drivers are issued 20 percent more tickets than white drivers. And Hispanic drivers received 30 percent more tickets than other drivers. Hispanic drivers were most likely to be searched, least likely to have contraband.  Wow.  Hispanics are the ones getting the most racism. That's that's like finding out the hotel room next door has even more semen than yours.  I mean, part of you is happy, but the other part is like, oh, man, I love the nerd room. Come on.  Now, one of the more interesting pieces of information that came from the Stanford study was that in areas where police regularly make broken taillight stops, stops of black and Hispanic people are both about 20 percent more likely for broken taillights than stops of white people. So if you're a minority who wants to reduce your chances of getting stopped, you've got to make sure your taillight is never out. And if you're thinking. But, Trevor, that's impossible. You've clearly never met Leo Debnam.  Are you tired of being pulled over for being black? Of course you are. Police make it up all kinds of reasons. Is this car stolen? You have a gun. Did you kidnap this white woman sitting next to you? And, of course, their favorite son? Your taillight is broken.  Officer, I might be broke, but my taillight is just fine with the Leo Develin forever tail. Like the police will have to come up with a better reason to whip your ass. These are the punk ass. Tail lights break under pressure, but not the forever tail like this indestructible tail light is made for one hundred percent plexiglass. A light so strong can make a baseball bat say goddamn Plexiglas. Let's say the pope got to this Catholic. I know what you're thinking.  How did I get my hands on some of that Pope glass? That's none of your goddamn business, which you should be asking me is if it works, right?  It does. You know why I pulled you over, man.  Tail light, though, is for Africa cocaine they planted in my car. Thanks, Leo. Dublin. With the flare of tail light, you ain't never gonna stop for the Pope.  Pope is policeman chasing me for three hours. What? I ain't stopping because I know my tail light. Good. My white woman Leo. It ain't been eighty five dollars. You get that from your mama. Black don't crack, neither should your tail light. Leo Devlins and the Institute of Public. That means forever and ever. It's a 120 by the fairgrounds next to Little Caesar's. He's home, brave, say ablaut, espanol. In the criminal justice system, there are laws and then there are laws that are dumb and make no sense, these are their stories.  We're now learning more about why Glynn County police never arrested either of the two men involved in the shooting death of twenty five year old Amont Aubury, a district attorney. Barnhill states in this letter that both men are protected under Georgia's citizen's arrest law. Citizen's arrest thought that was just some bullshit people said on TV.  But in real life, a citizen's arrest.  No Barney Fife shit. You are a individual that's 20 some odd years of age and individuals are running after you, blocking you in with cars. That's call honey. That's the wild, wild west that we talked about. This is Georgia State Representative Carl Gilliard, someone who is just as outraged about this as I am.  The citizen's arrest law gives individual citizens the right to arrest someone up to 48 hours until law enforcement would arrive.  So not only can you citizen's arrest somebody, you can just keep them for two days.  Like misere people are using laws as a justification for murder, as a justification for lynching. You have a higher form of racism. They're not wearing hoods anymore. Underwear, shirts and ties.  Yes, I'd like to play a halo. I think you're correct.  How is this still a law? Well, no one's challenged, this law was conceived in 1863, you know, it's just it's outdated. Hmm.  What possibly could have been happening in Georgia in 1863? I ask, knowing I won't like the answer.  This particular law was written during the Civil War and was a way of preventing enslaved Africans who were trying to escape to the union lines. It empowered any white person to arrest any black person.  So on a scale of Betty White to David Duke, how racist is this citizen's arrest law?  You tell me when to stop at that stage to do what?  One of the big things about Georgia is the man in charge of writing the formal laws. Thomas Cobb is an avid racist wave of racist.  You wrote books justifying racism, basically arguing that African-Americans were better off than slaves and could never really function as free people. Oh, shit, that is it. OK, continue Cobb himself.  He dies in 1862, but the system of law he had established for Georgia lives on.  And that becomes the the basis of protection for racists like the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War because they could lynch any African-American and claim it was a citizen's arrest. How is this still a law?  We still have a racist society.  We haven't gotten rid of so many elements of racism in the United States.  Well, that settles it. I talk to the experts. I studied the finest legal texts and I can confirm this law must be changed, but I have no idea how to do that.  Joe, how is this still a law? All these injustices are happening and nobody's doing anything to stop it. I am what you are. That's why I authored House Bill Toivo three.  You're proposing a law that gets rid of the law. That's a terrible law. There are some people that are trying to move forward.  Oh, cool.  As it turns out, one of the things filling up Karl's cat calendar is a bill to repeal the current citizen's arrest law.  And he's getting ready to drop it like it's don't say it.  We are getting ready to drop it. You know, like it's not. He said it's a movement. Now, the old Jim Crow has had a bowel movement and we're in a whole new movement.  So repealing the citizen's arrest law is a laxative against the Jim Crow constipation that's been holding up the progress of the black man. What we need to do with that, let's face, is to stand your ground, execute, and then we need to take a no chokehold attitude, and then we need to take a voting registration suppression laxative and get all of that moved out and into the toilet of justice. Not only time will tell if citizen's arrest gets flushed into the sewage system of history, but we're definitely a step closer to getting rid of this law for the entire country.  No, this is for Georgeanne. Oh, shit. How many states have a citizen's arrest?  LOL, all of them, with the exception of maybe two. So we got work to do. We've got work to do.

While states like New York are finally passing legislation that tries to stop police violence, those changes are being resisted by a very powerful force.  The police unions, in fact, just listen to the head of the New York Police Union, Pat Lynch, lashing out at police reform.  They're asking us to pull back. They're asking us to walk away from you. They're asking us to abandon our communities. They're asking me to walk away from where I live. They're asking me to walk away from where I work. They're asking us to walk away from the neighborhoods that we brought back. And that's what's happening. And you know what? We don't have a choice.  If we put our hands on the criminal, you're going to jail, I'm not being dramatic, that's how bad it is.  OK, with all due respect, I, I think you are being dramatic. No policeman is going to jail for touching somebody.  This is almost like the police version of those guys during me to remember those guys were like, you know what? I can't even smile at a lady in the office anymore. I'll just cut my dick off. Now, we know that's coming next. Nobody is asking the police to abandon their communities. People are asking the police to treat all communities like it is their community. I mean, think about the fact that this guy even says we can't even put our hands on a criminal.  That's part of the problem. All too often in America, police treat everyone that they come across like a criminal, especially black people. And I'm not being dramatic. That's just how it is not for those who don't know. Police unions fight for their members in the ways that all unions do. They organize for better pay and they organize for benefits. There are a lot of good things that come from having a police union, but they also protect members in ways that make it virtually impossible to hold bad cops accountable.  They set the terms of internal investigations that accused cops can stonewall until the department has to give up. And then if a cop is found to be at fault, unions can put limits on the penalties so that even police chiefs who want to fire the officers who've done something wrong can't do it. And on top of all of that, there are even examples of police threatening not to do their jobs if politicians try to hold them accountable, which I'm sorry is ridiculous.  Can you imagine if nurses threatened to let patients die, if they're not allowed to steal opioids and sell them on the side? No one would accept that. And so the question is, what can Americans do if police unions, all this powerful? What can people do? Well, for more on this, I'm joined by our very own union expert, Roy Wood, Jr.. What's going on, Roy?  How are you doing? What's how you been? Well, I'm I'm as good as I can be. And I'm assuming you've seen that video of Pat Lynch, the head of the New York Police Union. What did you make of the video?  Yes, I saw Henry Winkler up at the microphone doing his thing, looked like Henry Winkler. I thought it was a Happy Days reboot. I was like, this is a terrible time to bring back this show.  Also sidebar, if you're a police union and you vote somebody to be the head of the police union, you probably shouldn't have them be named Pat Lynch. Also, the question, what are the rest of the black people that are on this diverse police department? Look at this photo that look like a 50 year reunion of a lacrosse team.  Yeah, and Roy, another problem is that the police unions are now basically showing people what a powerful force they are. They're standing up against the reforms and and they're so well organized. The politicians are afraid of them. So, like, the question I have for you is, is there anything that can be done to weaken the influence they have?  The African you think about it and see, here's the thing. Everybody's trying to make the police union weaker with. All you need to do is make a stronger union that's stronger than the police union. That's why I propose that all black people come together and we form. A black people union is called the National Black Association. Wait, hold up. The NBA. Now, think of another name. The point is, is that what's this union is together?  It brings together every black person in the country. And if you're black, you're automatically approved. It's the opposite of a home loan.  OK, fine. And then what happens once you have the Black Union? How does that help?  Once to organize every year will make America negotiate a new deal with us. And with our strength in numbers. We can finally get our demands met, hold cops accountable for misconduct, demilitarize the police, shift funding away from cops and toward schools and education. And while we're at it, rescue Kanye West from the second place. We need them back.  OK, look, Roy, that sounds like fair demands, but what if America and the Black Union can't agree on a deal? What happens then?  Well, then black people are just have to take our talents elsewhere. Like when LeBron left Cleveland. Only now is black people leaving all of America. Does America really want that? Do you really want to be without black people? No sports, no music, no more dance moves, no Tic-Tac doing the hokey pokey. You have to believe. Good luck going viral with that shit.  Wow."}]}

Today is February twenty second, which means it's the last week of Black History Month, which is why I've decided now is the perfect time to make some new black history by being the first black man to ski down Mount Everest.  I tripped getting into my UBA anyway.  On tonight's show, it's raining plain parts in Colorado. Michael Costa proves that election fraud is real and why everything is bigger in Texas, including the electricity bills. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah is a. Let's kick things off with some travel news if you're one of those people who can't wait to fly on an airplane again. Well, first of all, congratulations on being basic. And second, you may be willing to wait just a little longer after seeing this.  This morning, the FAA and Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau grounding all Boeing triple sevens with a specific Pratt and Whitney engine as the NTSB investigates how this triple seven engine fell apart in midair just after takeoff.  Two hundred and thirty one passengers aboard United three. Twenty eight from Denver to Honolulu Saturday. That terrifying sight right outside their windows overnight. The NTSB saying two fan blades on the engine were fractured. You can see a broken fan blade in this image on the ground, massive pieces of metal falling onto neighborhoods, some running away, trying to avoid getting hit by pieces falling out of the sky.  I swear on my head, this giant piece falling on Kirby Clements lawn, crushing his truck, looked out the window.  I go, oh, no, that's the front end of an airplane. God damn.  A giant piece of an airplane landing in your front yard. That's terrifying. I mean, on the other hand, how great is it to get something complimentary from an airline? For once, customer service is back.  And as terrifying as this moment was, what's really impressive is that someone was on a plane, so the engine was on fire and the first impulse to take out their phone and record it.  That's how addictive it is to go viral. Every single one of us will spend our last moments of life chasing tweets.  I'm going down, but all my legs are going up. But at the same time, you're also on a plane. So, I mean, there's there's really no other good way to spend your last few minutes on Earth. Oh, God.  The plane is going down. The plane is going down. Let me just load. Crude's too.  Seriously, though, it is hard to overstate how terrible this was. I mean, yet nobody got hurt, but the plane was headed to Honolulu and instead it had to land in Denver. Tell me that that's not a tragedy. Oh, and just by the way, it turns out that this wasn't even the only Boeing accident this week.  Yeah. At this point, Boeing has such a terrible record that people won't even wait for something to go wrong before they say goodbye to their loved ones. Hey, man, I just want to say that I love you and I'm grateful that you were my friend. Dude, what happened?  Do you find out you have cancer?  No, I just booked a flight on a Boeing. No.  But let's move on now to the coronavirus pandemic. It's the reason all your sex dreams are now just about going out bowling.  There's no question that things in the US are moving in the right direction. More people are getting the vaccine, fewer people are getting infected. And our meshuggeneh is finally starting to clear up. But at the same time, things are still very bad. And today, the country reached a grim milestone to remind all of us of that the coronavirus and the pandemics once unthinkable toll in the US.  More than five hundred thousand lives lost in less than one year.  The first reported fatality came on February twenty nine. Three months later, it was one hundred thousand dead.  And then by mid-September, the death toll climbed to two hundred thousand and surpassed three hundred thousand by mid-December.  But then came the deadliest period in the pandemic. Four hundred thousand deaths on January 19th. And now, just one month later, here we are, half a million covid deaths in this country.  President Biden will mark the milestone at the White House with a moment of silence and a candle lighting ceremony.  That's right, people. Five hundred thousand covid deaths, a number that nobody wanted to see. And as painful as that is, you have to admit, you have to admit it is nice to see America's president actually take a moment, just a moment to recognize the toll that coronavirus has taken. I mean, the only time the previous president showed any sadness was when he accidentally deleted FOX News off of his DVR.  What a day for Americans was that day. My sweet Hannity is gone.  The good news is that the number of new infections has plummeted in the last few weeks.  But what's interesting is the number that they've plummeted to is where they were last July, which at the time everyone thought was so horrifying that the country immediately started locking down again. And this just goes to show you that your perspective can change based on where you're coming from. That's it's like if I go to tech right now by a wolf, I'd probably be like, this is the worst day of my life.  But if I went from being attacked by four wolves to one wolf, I'd probably be like, oh, what a relaxing way to start the week.  So, look, this is why it's so important to get people vaccinated as quickly as possible.  And don't give me any excuses about how you're too busy or it's not convenient. Last weekend, a 19 year old Seattle woman walked six miles in the snow to keep her appointment because the roads hadn't been plowed, which is incredible, although if you believe old people's stories, walking miles in the snow is what they do all the time. They love that shit. But still, if a 90 year old woman can do it, you can do it, too.  And don't tell me. But I'm not 90 years old. I'm too young to get the vaccine right now. That's also no excuse for a strange story now showing the lengths to Florida women we're willing to go to to get the vaccine. And they are caught dressing as grannies just so they can get the shot. Now, here's the thing. It worked for them the first time around. Officials say the women are thirty four and forty four years old.  So you can see one of the more a bonnet and a long cardigan. The other didn't make much of an effort to cover up a vaccinator. Thought they looked funny. So they were stopped before getting their shots, and that's when they found out both women had faked their birth dates. Now officials want to know how they were able to get away with getting the first shot. The women are not facing any charges, but police did yell at them, calling their actions selfish.  OK, this is outrageous. You call that dressing up as a granny. All that woman did was put a bandage on and that other one didn't do anything, put on a wig, hunched over or even easier. Just download the Facebook app on your phone. I mean, if you got that, you're seventy five minimum. If you want to cheat your way to the vaccine, you at least have to put in the work. No one would have bought the charade.  I'm pretty sure Mrs. Doubtfire wouldn't have gotten the kids back if he just showed up like, Hey, it's me, Mrs. Doubtfire, I'm your nanny.  How did they even think that they could pretend to be old women at that age? I mean, personally, I blame porn, you know, they start putting women in the category of twenty six. Of course we have unrealistic ideas of what grannies look like, but what's crazy is they would have gotten away with it if the doctors hadn't gotten suspicious. Hey, wait a minute. If you're a grandma, how come you haven't tried to set me up with one of your grandkids yet?  But let's move on now to our main story, the ongoing crisis in Texas. A week after the state was battered by winter storms that took out the power grid, nearly nine million people still don't have clean water. But don't worry, help is on the way after getting blasted for flying to Cancun when his own heat went off.  Ted Cruz, Texas senator and Disney princess before True Love's kiss is now back in his home states doing the literal bare minimum for the sake of the cameras.  Ted Cruz appearing back in front of the cameras. He spent the weekend helping Houston residents and first responders who served barbecue to firefighters and police officers, also delivered safe drinking water to folks who need it. Sorry, Cruz, this is not going to cut it, my man. Men see this right here. This is the politician version of coming home with flowers the day after Valentine's Day is not nothing, but your ass is still sleeping on the couch. And honestly, I don't know why politicians try to pull off these lame photo ops.  They basically just turn people who actually need real help into political props and their photographers probably just make it worse. Yes. Yes, that's fabulous. Yes, yes, yes. Pottermore, Pottermore. Like, you don't have any food or water, but I don't have any food or water. Great use that. Use that. Yes, Fenice.  Now, fortunately, most Texans do have their electricity back on now so they can finally log on to all those meetings that really should have just been emails. But even some people who didn't lose their power are finding out that they weren't as lucky as they first thought. The desperation growing in Texas. Temperatures are finally rising, but so is outrage over absurdly high electric bills.  Texans like Scott Willoughby, who signed up for gritty energy, not knowing his rate could vary with the market. So when power supply went down from the storm, his typically two hundred dollar bill took off.  What was the damage? Sixteen thousand seven hundred ninety eight dollars, something like that. And this was not a bill. This was withdrawn. This was withdrawn straight from my account in Fort Worth.  The utility company charged Ty Williams seventeen thousand dollars.  So we were held hostage really with our our rate that we were working with is really crazy.  I'm trying to get gas and groceries and make sure that my pipeline explodes. The last thing that I'm thinking about is a seven thousand dollar bill from my utility.  Wow. People. Seventeen thousand dollars for electricity. At that point, it's cheaper to literally burn your own money for warmth. That's probably one Amish guy on the street right now. All smug as hell seeing the story. He's eating a homemade stick of butter like I told them. So, bitches. Because seriously, people at seventeen thousand dollars, it's almost not worth having any electricity. I mean, at the very least, you're going to have to make extremely tough choices.  Do you charge grandma's oxygen machine or your PlayStation controller? Because, I mean, grandma needs the oxygen to live, but you can't just stop playing Assassin's Creed, Valhalla before you unite in England.  And I think grandma would have understood that. But the question is, why are some Texans being hit with bills bigger than their belt buckles? Well, unlike every other state, it turns out Texas has very few regulations on its utility companies.  And this free market system used to be the pride of Texas. In fact, a couple of years ago, Ted Cruz was bragging that the success of Texas energy was built over many years on free enterprise and low regulation. But now now that Texans are being charged twenty thousand dollars to toast a bagel. Cruz has discovered that regulation might not be so bad.  Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz tweeting, This is wrong. No power company should get a windfall because of a natural disaster. And Texans should not get hammered by ridiculous rate increases for last week's energy debacle. State and local regulators should act swiftly to prevent this injustice.  All you tell him, Ted Cruz, the only Texan that should be getting hammered, is me at the hotel bar in Cancun.  So, yes, Ted Cruz has reversed his stance on regulation like it was a flight path to Mexico.  And I mean, let's be honest, nobody forced these Texans to choose the world's shadiest company for their electricity. But also nobody really talked about the worst case scenario when they touted the wonders of an unregulated markets. When conservatives talk about freedom from governments, they only focus on the good things. But that's not the whole picture. If you were running a zoo and you told all the antelopes, congrats, guys, we're giving you all the freedom to roam around the zoo, that's good news.  But it would be only fair to tell them that the lions are also going to be getting that freedom because that shit is not as good for the antelopes as you make it sound. All right. When we come back, Michael Costa shows us how humans aren't the only species with election fraud scandals around.  We think America finally ready for this, a show by black people. For all people about the black experience in America, it's time to go there. Coming Tuesday night on ABC, Soul of a Nation, all the pain, all the joy, unafraid, funny, beautiful.  And there will be news coming to ABC Tuesday night at 10:00. Nonsense. So some of this is coming and I hope you'll watch Soul of a Nation. I'll be watching The Daily Show, Eres Edition.

And I was a young kid at the time and I'm a very loyal person. People know me for that. And, you know, you get yourself in situations and you don't really think when you're young, you just more react, you know, going through that situation. It taught me to actually think before actually responding or actually reacting to things. I was very fortunate to be able to go through that process and come out of it and find a rainbow at the end, if you will.  I took a negative. I took myself and I was completely invested in whatever the consequences was. And I went through that process and I came out on top. And I like to think that it made me a better person. I like to think that it made me shrink my my so-called circle of friends, too. It made me rethink a lot of things that were going on in my life as a young individual. And I can I can honestly say that was a pivotal point in my life to where a lot of things changed for me, along with my attitude to things.  I feel I feel that I mean, I could relate to the parts of the book where I read when I went, man, just one mistake as a kid can change your life depending on how you get punished for that mistake.

And then a fluffy egg and real cheese floated over the side, looking just so good. Mm hmm. Grilled onions on about a bagel. Two thumbs up from McDonald's steak, egg and cheese bagel for breakfast.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about Republicans Accept Biden's Victory | Barack Obama."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or two or three writers who I admire who wrote Obama's making it a mission to chastise Black Lives Matter? You know what? Hold on a second.  I just spent the whole summer complimenting them. What are you talking about? The reason it caught attention, I suspect, is there were some in the Democratic Party who suggested the reason we didn't do better in the congressional elections this time was because of this phrase. And I think that people assumed that somehow I was making an argument that that's why we didn't get, you know, a bigger Democratic majority.  That actually was not the point I was making. I was making a very particular point around.  If we, in fact, want to translate the the the very legitimate belief that how we do policing needs to change and that if there is, for example, a homeless guy ranting and railing in the middle of the street. Sending a. A mental health worker. Rather than an armed, untrained police officer, to deal with that person might be a better outcome for all of us and make us safer. Right, that if we describe that to. Not just white folks, but let's say Michelle's mom.  That makes sense to them. But if we say defund the police, not just white folks, but Michelle's mom might say, if I'm getting robbed, who am I going to call and is somebody going to show up? Right. So the issue here becomes, you know, at any given time, how are we translating and using language not to make people more comfortable, quote unquote? Right. Because that's always a strain. And historically, the concern in these debates is also is often or are we just trying to make white people comfortable rather than speaking truth to power?  Right. That's the framework. We tend to think about these things, right? Yeah. The issue to me is not making them comfortable. It is. Can we be precise with our language enough that people who might be. Persuaded around that particular issue to make a particular change that gets a particular result that we want, what's the best way for us to describe that?  And you're basically saying is we should workshop all of our slogans with Michelle? That's what I say. That probably would be wise. It would work. But but I want to go back to something you said earlier, which I think is really important. And I and I said this in the wake of some of this criticism, I said, look, part of this is also everybody has different roles to play. An activist, a movement leader is is going to provide a prophetic voice and speak certain truths that somebody who is going to be elected into office will not be able to say.  I reread James Baldwin's a fire next time this summer. How is it that something written 50 years ago? Fifty five years ago. Yeah, yeah.  Applies directly today. Right. Despite everything that's happened.  To me, that is a searing and as honest a a portrayal of the the the gaping wound of race in America.  But of course, James Baldwin can be elected to the US Senate or unlikely that he would want to be the mayor of a city who's responsible for figuring out how do I deal with the police union. Right. That's somebody else's role. And and all these roles are important.  And so, you know, why do you think if I may interrupt, why do you think, though, that Republicans or right wingers now do that? That's that's something that I've struggled to to to understand. You see, now, even in this election, I mean, some of the Republicans who are running were Kuhnen supporters and they were going, we're running. And this is what and some of them were winning. Some of them are so extreme and they're winning.  And so I sometimes wonder if if there's this this isn't just a political thing in America where if you if you're in the Republican Party, you can be completely bombastic in what you believe in.  And then as a Democrat, you're trying to tow the line between centrist and and and left leaning. No.  Well, because I think, in fact, the Republican Party is the minority party in this country. The only reason that it doesn't look like they're the minority party is because of structures like the US Senate. And the Electoral College that don't render them the majority party, so so they have certain built-In advantages around power given their population distribution and how our government works. But the truth of the matter is, is that 60 percent of the people are occupying what I would consider a more reality based universe.  And those are the those are the constituents we're speaking to. And that is a more diverse group. You know, I describe in the book the first time I go to the to the Republican House caucus to speak to them. And I think there was an Asian guy or gal and maybe a couple of Hispanics, and that was it. It is much more homogeneous, which means that, yes, they have to do less work, but it also.  Means that they are they can talk to themselves. And as a consequence of the way our democracy, our republic is structured, they don't have to appeal to as broad of a base. That's not fair. But, you know, I at least would prefer not having the progressives model ourselves out of our model ourselves on on the current Republican Party, that doesn't feel like a good strategy to me to get the outcomes that we want.  When we come back, President Obama reflects on whether he should have roasted Donald Trump back in 2011.  Don't want to miss it. Ever wondered why there are two ways to spell doughnut's or why some people think you can find water underground just by wandering around with a stick? Believe it or not, this is stuff you should know. You know the podcast with over a billion listeners. It's now for your eyes so you can read it. Stuff you should know. An incomplete compendium of mostly interesting things covers everything from the origin of the Murphy bed to why people get lost, become the most interesting person you know.  Now at stuff you should know dotcom or wherever books are sold. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Here is the final part of my interview with President Obama. I asked him about his legacy and what part he might have played in the rise of President Trump. Let's talk a little bit about let's loosen things up.  Let's unbutton one of those one one of those buttons on the shirt.  As someone who I consider to be one of the best deliverers of jokes and and roasts, are you going to be more careful going forward about who you are? And I say this because you roasted Donald Trump, who ran for president. You roasted Kanye West. He ran for president. So I don't know if you've noticed, but you have an ability to inspire people to run for the highest office in the land with some of the jokes that you tell about them.  Well, I should I should roast people, people I admire more. I'll start roasting. You met. Who knows, although you were born here. So.  Yeah, but I was in the department.  Who knows?  Before I let you go, I wanted to know one last thing, and that is being president of the United States is arguably the toughest job in the world when you transition back to a question of life. I wonder what that is like, because unlike you, I don't have that power, I've never been able to, like, just change a thing in the world or do something about it. But now, in many ways, you are like me in that you see the thing on the TV and then you get angry or sad, but you cannot really do anything about it.  And so I wonder, as as former President Barack Obama, have you have you transitioned into that completely or do you find different ways to try and fix the problems that you see in the world?  Well, first of all, I'm not anything like you. I still have a lot of clout. So let's just be clear. Come on. I'll give you some perspective.  I was hoping you I was hoping you just let that one slide. I was hoping you'd just be like, yeah, you know, in many ways.  Look, the truth is that. I I did not have those kinds of withdrawals, and I know that there are people who I know who've had them when they leave public life and very visibly, you know, they want to get back on stage. Yeah, Michelle and I, that's something we share. We feel good about the work we did. We don't feel anxiety about not being the center of attention. We get frustrated like I think citizens around the world and here in the country do when we see something unjust or unfair.  And yes, the goal, I think, for us is to find new ways to have that same impact, understanding that we'll never have the exact same impact as you have office.  But, you know, a lot of the work around the foundation is, you know, you said create a lot of Obama's. I'm not sure that's the goal. But to, you know, if 10 years, 20 years down the road, there are a thousand ten thousand one hundred thousand young people who are now moving into positions of authority and power and in some ways have been shaped by our example in a positive way. Yeah, that that's the legacy that may exceed anything that we did while we were in in our formal positions.  And and that feels pretty good. Well, I can talk to you for hours, but luckily I have a 700 page book to answer the rest of my questions. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for taking the time. And yeah. Thank you for being you, Mr.. Mr. President, thank you for joining me on The Daily Show.  We'll do it again.  Don't forget President Obama's memoir, A Promised Land is available now.

So you have this competition where people are traveling literally around the globe and the taking part in different events and competing but with their dog. So like when your dog makes you lose, is it the dog's fault or is it your fault for not training the dog adequately? Oh, I mean, you know, it's hard to say a lot of the dogs had had a hard time because, you know, even though they would be good at a task, let's say a crowd forming while we're shooting, and so they were distracted.  And so it's not necessarily their fault because they're really good at the task. But I mean, the humans get distracted as well. Right. Right. I see it's a team effort. There are some challenges that were more geared towards the dog, obviously, and some that were more geared towards a human. I think that the dogs probably excelled sometimes more than the humans. But that was that's the entertaining part of the show. And I don't know, I watched the first episode and I cried.  So I think you're going to you're going to have a lot of emotions. I think it's just really nice. With everything that's going on right now, you can kind of see the world without actually having to travel and watch a lot of dogs and slowmo, which, let's face it, everyone wants to see.  You're not the only one who would probably cry when watching the first episode because you have Lucy right there next to you, who is your co-host for the show. But then you have two other dogs. You have Leo and you have Bear, and they they're not your co-hosts. And I think that they're going to be really sad when they watch the show and be like, wow, how come Lucy got chosen and we didn't.  Is there a reason? Do you have a favorite? You know what you're saying, Lindsay?  You know, I actually my favorite dog is actually not her.  It's my other dog, Leo, and I wish I could travel with them, but there are like one hundred pounds each. And also they always get into trouble, i.e. they got into a fight with the porcupine and like a couple of weeks ago. And so I just I can't rely on them. Like Lucy's a talent and she's always there. She may be sleeping but at least she's there. You know, the boys boys are trouble.  Lindsey Vonn isn't just making shows, she's also producing shows. She's also going to be co directing a documentary about her hero and a skiing legend, Peekaboo Streets. You talked about her being the reason that you got into the sport. What is it like to not come full circle and be the person who is going to be documenting her life?  It's so rewarding. I mean, I can't tell you I wouldn't be excited for any other project besides this one. I mean, she is why I'm here. And now I get to show her the respect that I feel so strongly about her and be able to tell her story. And obviously, working with Frank Marshall is a dream come true. He's a legend.  One thing I've really enjoyed about watching your journey post sports has been how much you've just like you've you've become comfortable being uncomfortable in the space of inspiring others.  And what I mean by that is like it's easy to be inspiring. It's easier to be inspiring when you're winning races, when you're doing your thing, when you're out there. But like we've seen a side of Lindsey Vonn over the past year that, like a lot of people never knew beforehand. You know, we've seen Lindsey Vonn sharing like her journey of how hard it is to stay in shape now that she's not a professional athlete. We've seen the Lindsey Vonn, who I think has changed so many people's lives by going like, hey, I'm going to be on Instagram and I'm going to take pictures in my bikini because I'm on a vacation.  And you know what I'm not going to do? I'm not going to retouch these pictures, not because you shouldn't, but just because I don't want you to think that I'm perfect in a way that I'm not. I'm perfect the way that I am.  That is terrifying and it's very terrifying. Truly terrifying.  Like, how do you how do you get to that place where you go? You know what? I know the Internet is going to come for me. I know there's going to be trolls. I know people are going to chip away at my self-esteem, but I'm going to do this and I'm going to make this my course. Why did Lindsey Vonn choose to do that? You know, I've I've felt for the last 10 years that I've gotten that people have come after me, they've chipped away at my self-confidence, and I really wish I could say that I have such tough skin that nothing ever got to me.  But that's just not the case. You know, I think you're not human if some of those negative things don't get to you in some way, shape or form. But I think now finally comfortable enough in my skin where I can say, this is me. I don't care if you come after me. I don't care if you think that I'm someone that I'm not. I'm not perfect. And actually no one is. So the fact that we're trying to be perfect is counterintuitive.  Like, we should just accept who we are.  We're all unique, we're all beautiful, we're all special. And I think with covid, you know, I just kind of realize what's important to me. And I think I had to take a moment to really think about who I am and what I want and the image I want to portray. And I'm myself. And that's the image that I want to show people. I'm on myself. I'm raw, unedited. I'm one hundred percent me. Take it or leave it.  I'll tell you this as a friend and as a human being, I've always admired you for being a legend on the slopes. But I think your legacy will be even more legendary for all the things that you're doing off the slopes. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again. Look after yourself and good luck with Leo and Ben when they find out that you betrayed them.  Thanks, Trever. You're the best. Thanks, Linsey. See you again. Don't forget, the PAC premieres on Amazon Prime video this Friday, November 20th. Well, that's our show for tonight. But before we go, Thanksgiving is coming up. And in the era of Corona, I wanted to remind you that there are many seniors who are stuck at home and are at greater risk than ever because many of them don't know where their next meal is coming from.  Now, luckily, Meals on Wheels is out there in the streets delivering meals to elderly Americans every single day in communities around the country. Until tomorrow, though, stay safe out there, wear a mask. And remember, it's not about the size of the tree. It's about the motion of no, that doesn't work. Yeah, it's about the size of the tree.

I mean, it's twenty, twenty one now. But this was the first time that that ever happened. And so I'm sure a lot of people look at you and go like, man, OK, you you making films now for all the black women.  And you you you succeed for all black women and you feel for all black women. How are you a. To create creatively without stressing about that burden that you can feel, you know, some sections of society putting on you, whether it's the media or whoever it may be going like Regina, you do this for every black woman or you fail for every black woman.  Yeah. I mean, it's it's kind of like always a dance because it's very easy to just get consumed with that energy or that narrative that it does exist. And I mean, it is true. I mean, we don't get the opportunity as black people to fill up if we mess up, know that's pretty much it. Usually we don't get another chance. So I do recognize that.  And sometimes it does feel like it feels kind of weighty. Sometimes I speak to other people that I know feel the same way, but in that I feel like God wouldn't have brought me to it if I wasn't going to get through it. So I know that I must have been designed for this moment. So I'm figuring it out along the way when those anxious moments come. And in all actuality, I'm still always getting inspiration from from all over.  I mean, like just I just got introduced to this 14 year old girl. I think her name is Kayla Love Jones, who did her first short. And it's in the Pan African Film Festival in the Urban World Film Festival. And that is inspiring to me. You know, it's like I I'm just always. Trying to plug in wherever I can plug in and in and pick up some some energy to keep the trajectory being an upward one and not the lateral.  I've said this to you before, and I'll say it again. I don't know how you stay as humble as you are with all the gold trophies you have.

And boy, it does seem to be happening here. I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.  The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about If You Don't Know, Now You Know - America's Power Grid | Kevin Garnett."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "America's living in twenty, twenty one with an electric grid that's barely been updated in the past 50 years. You have to update technology more often than that. People I mean, imagine trying to get through your life with the first iPhone. You couldn't even use the maps app because New York wasn't the state back then. So clearly, the grid needs to be upgraded and we'd better do it soon because the problem is heating up.  The last half century, there had been more and more power outages because of weather, and it will only get worse because of our changing climate.  The grids are facing more extreme conditions more often, and it's susceptible to really, really major failures.  Are red is no match for wildfires, no match for hurricanes and flooding. As weather patterns and temperatures get more and more extreme, the extremely hot and extremely cold days end up driving the most significant peaks that utilities have to manage.  Air conditioners can account for up to half of the electricity being used in the country. The first thing that happens when you have a hot day is people use their air conditioners.  And the increase in the abundance of air conditioning throughout the country certainly means that more people can turn on air conditioning at all at about the same time.  That's right. America is using way more air conditioning than its grid can handle. And I know that for a fact. Offices in this country are so cold you could store Korona vaccines in your desk. And thanks to the extreme temperatures that climate change creates, this problem is only going to get worse. And maybe you're not worried. Maybe you're thinking, oh, eventually climate change is going to get so bad that I'll be stuck between a wildfire and a blizzard creating the perfect temperature.  But on the off chance that that doesn't happen, America needs to find alternative methods of climate control like I know I do, that, you know, when I'm cold, I just turn on Bridgton, all those accents, the cool Gene Page's smoulder, I'm hot already, OK, but it's not just nature that's putting the electric grid at risk.  It's also technology of all the critical components of the U.S. infrastructure. The power grid is one of the most vulnerable to cyber attack.  Imagine if the critical infrastructure we rely on every single day simply shut down power plants, banking systems, air traffic.  Control subways, all are vulnerable. Russian government hackers are actively trying to penetrate the grid to carry out potential attacks.  They are already in the grid. The Russians are in the Chinese or the Iranians may be on the verge of getting here.  Ironically, it's our less sophisticated electric providers who may have an edge here. Rural co-ops account for forty two million people. None of these co-ops relies on the Internet for the distribution of power.  That's right, people. Sometimes the less fancy something is, the more you can count on. It's like Danny DeVito. That's why when everyone is messing around with this Spotify playlists on the iPhone Twelve's, I'm jamming out to CDs on my old reliable Discman.  It spin it spin. It spans.  But those rural providers aside, America is in real trouble here. If America's electricity is hacked, that could mean hospitals lose power, the banking system collapses. Boeing planes fall out of the sky even more than they already do. And there are so many countries already in America's grid that they're probably just arguing over who will actually get to cause the blackouts. What are you doing? Get out of here. We want were here first. Get out of here.  You already did an election. Give us something, huh? In fact, you know what they need to do? They need to update the Geneva Conventions for this new kind of warfare. They've got to be like, OK, look, we can bomb each other as much as we want, but can we agree? No cutting power when there's a new one division that's a war crime. So this is a scary future that the world is facing. But the good news is the United States now has the space force.  I mean, they won't be able to protect the power grid, but if it does go down, someone in space can look down on earth and be like, yo, it looks like the lights are out down there, everything's off.  And that, my friends, is huge. Now, luckily, hackers haven't done any major damage to America's power grid yet, but wait till you hear what has one of the biggest threats to the US power grid isn't state actors are natural disasters.  It's that little gray mammal invading your bird feeder. In fact, it's difficult to know the severity of our squirrel sabotage problem because it happens so frequently, utility industry groups say, to the most common cause of grid trouble, they cause one of every five outages. One ill fated squirrel could knock out power for thousands of customers or trip up whole financial markets. Squirrels have short circuited Nasdaq not once but twice from the same city in Connecticut.  Well, well, well. Turns out squirrels have been sabotaging us and we shouldn't be surprised.  I mean, have you ever seen a squirrel? They always look like they're plotting some shit. And I guess it turns out if squirrels were the real threat all along, some of us need to start apologizing to our dogs because it turns out they were good boys, very good boys. So, yes, when you look at the state of America's electric grid, it is not a pretty picture. It's under threat from climate change, from hackers and even jumped up rats.  Honestly, just thinking about how the entire country could be shut down in an instant is starting to stress me out. In fact, I'm getting so stressed, I think I'm just going to take a moment to listen to some of my relaxing tunes. Yeah, yeah. All right.

Earlier today, I spoke with NBA champion and 15 time All-Star Kevin Garnett. We talked about his Hall of Fame, career, life before and after basketball and where to from here. Kevin Garnett, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Yeah, man is too dope to have you. First thing's first like why? Why is it so dark? What's going on over there? You know what? We're not in the studio. I like lighting myself, I don't like the regulation of light hitting me.  I was trying to tell the producers I got a high level of melanin. So you just got to deal with some of the stuff.  So I'm bring some balance to the whole Trubridge show today.  All right. All right. I feel it. I feel that we've got like we've got we've got we've got an ebb and flow going here. OK, I like that. I like my welcome to the show. Either way I can see you, I can feel your presence. And before we get into the book, let me say, first of all, congratulations on making it into the NBA Hall of Fame. And man, you did it in style as well because you're a first ballot Hall of Famer.  That's pretty amazing. How does it feel?  It feels amazing, you know, as you would know, putting putting all your time and effort into a craft and believing in yourself and wanting to grow a passion that's within you is not ideal in a in a black home, thinking big, dreaming big, all those things going to having the best imagination and chasing the dream only to find yourself in your dream and now you're in it. Now what do you do. So to be able to be able to reach heights, reach dreams.  I couldn't this I couldn't, I wrote this I couldn't came up with this in my wildest imagination.  Your your induction into the Hall of Fame comes with a bittersweet story to it because you inducted along your peer and your friend Kobe Bryant's know now he was a fellow giant in the sport. And one thing I've really always wondered about is how you could be friends with somebody when you guys wanted to kill each other on the court because you would watch the games, you know, when it was Celtics, Lakers. It's just like it's just like, God, I want to kill you.  And it's like you guys are friends off the court. Did that ever spill over when you have a two friendly on the court or a too aggressive in life? No, I think Copano had a great balance of respect for each other. I think when you hit the floor as gladiators, you have a respect but within the lines. But it's free game, you know, it's all about advantage. And you're trying to look for their advantage every minute, every second of the game.  And when you come off the court, it's a lot less intense, a lot more intimate. The conversations are obviously long running and in depth. But when you between the lines, there are no rules, only respect. And if you don't have respect, then it goes another way. But I think Kobana had a great understanding of each other. I met him when he was when he was very young. We started off when we were very young relationship.  And we and we and we kept that throughout our whole times in the league. So it's only right that we go in the hall together.  Yeah. It's been an amazing journey that you've been on. And I feel like you one of those people where every time I learn more about you, I like you more. Know, obviously I loved you as a basketball player because I was like, is killing the game, you know? And then in uncut gems, I was like, man, this is a new set of CGY. I never thought I would see. But now we get to live your life with you because you've released a memoir that's coming out this week, CGG A to Z to an uncensored encyclopedia of life, basketball and everything in between.  And you've literally written it like an encyclopedia. The book goes A, B, C, D all the way to Z. Talk me through why you decided to write a book like that, because, I mean, that's not how everyone writes a memoir. I'm not a memoir guy.  I'm more of a mathematician, a Mausi someone, the history of the world, geography.  You know, I'm not a you know, when I read a bunch of papers I skimmed through, I'm not always seen to be the A and, you know, I'm asking, you know, and I wanted the book to be able to be followed very easily.  I sometimes when I read stuff, I get lost in how the format, the paragraphs are really in depth. So I want to be able to write something that was easy to follow and, you know, something that you can enjoy.  It is enjoyable because you have lived a life. Everything in your in your book gives us insights into something. You know, if people love you on the court, there's parts about CGY on the court, there's parts of it like just where you learn things about who you are as a person like you. You, for instance, you have like you're a very serious player, but you love messing with people. You know, one of my favorite things you did and I never used to understand this because I only learned about basketball maybe like seven years ago, is I I would always see you hitting the ball away when people would shoot after the timeout has been called.  And I was always like, oh, do they get the point? And people like not Hajee just doesn't. It's like, why is he doing that? I was like, I don't know. But now we know it was because you were trying to mess with people who are trying to get their rhythm going.  It's it's a combination of things like confidence in on this level. When you play with guys in the league, only thing they need to see is the ball go through a couple of times or even one time. Reggie Miller, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, guys. Who are the guys who can actually beat you by just a blink of an eye, have that switch. And I used to be mindful of this switch and when guys would try to be shooting, have themselves a bad shooting.  Nice. I would I would just part of his being an asshole to be so kind of, you know, poking a little bit.  But a lot of it was just a throw off rhythm. And to really make someone really look like, no, stop doing that. And that's, you know, the more I can mess between, the more I saw it affected, the more I would probably do it. But yeah, it was effective. Yeah.  Man, you might call yourself a bit of an asshole at times, but man, there are parts of this book that show us how complicated and dynamic you as a person. You know, I really appreciated how you talked about struggling with attention deficit disorder, how you struggled living with dyslexia and learning how to learn without that or with that impediments in your life, it seems like something a lot of people wouldn't share, especially self-doubt. When people think of Kevin Garnett, we don't necessarily ever think of self doubt being in a sentence with your name.  Why do you think it was so important for you to share that with people and say, hey, these are the things that CGY has struggled with off the court job?  I want to give people confidence. I want to be able to say it's OK to have elements in the world of human. Everyone's not perfect. We all have flaws. Growing up, I didn't necessarily know what was going on. I didn't know why things appeared the way they were and why I was processing the way I was. So in this whole book, I want to be able to have the reader to be able to grab some solution from from what I from some of the things I was talking about that douchy speak on.  Is this the same doubt that Viju same about pushes you every day writing the message in that and having these ads or these deficits is to continue to push through. I never let any of this hold me back. I figured it out. It was an odd way to figure some of this stuff out, but it worked at the end, the date and the message. She has to continue to push through, no matter whatever it is, this is a solution to everything.  And I really like to believe that. So I want to share that with everybody to show the human side of me to, you know, people she race in this great athlete and you running and jumping in all this. And they don't really understand that. You know, it's a whole bunch of other things that go into the makeup of a person. So I want to show more human side of him.  And the book takes us into all the things that go into the makeup of this human in particular, one of the scariest stories to read in the book, because it just shows how much a person's life could change in an instant is when you talk about being in high school and getting into a fight defending your friend who is getting beaten up by these white kids, the next thing you know you will being put up for lynching charges, which is a capital offense where you were in South Carolina."}]}

Today is February 11th, which means, my friends, Valentine's Day is only three days away. I repeat, three days away. So just remember to leave out a plate of milk and cookies for Cupid or else he'll make you get a divorce. Anyway, on tonight's show, Democrats make their closing arguments against Donald Trump.  Jordan Klepper is back in D.C. for the first time since the riots. And why being nice to your mama might get you vaccinated. Plus, Daniel Kaluuya joins us on the show to talk about his brand new movie, Judas and the Black Messiah. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with no use. Let's talk about the coronavirus, the only thing with more mutations than Rudy Giuliani. There's good news in America as cases and hospitalizations continue to fall. But with dangerous coronavirus variants spreading around the country, the race is now on to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, which is why in Massachusetts they started doing this starting today.  In Massachusetts, vaccine eligibility begins for friends and family members who accompany a person who is seventy five years of age or older to their vaccine appointment. Only one companion per person is allowed to sign up for this vaccine appointment and a mass vaccination site regardless of their age or health.  Hell yeah. Massachusetts.  Oh, this is just like the club, but the exact opposite. The shots are free and if you have your grandma with you, you get in right away. But yes, anyone can get a vaccine in Massachusetts as long as they roll up with someone seventy five or over.  And you know what this means, right? It means everyone is going to want to make friends with old people in Massachusetts. Now, in fact, they should just make this the next season of The Bachelorette, who will get Gladys's syringe. Stay tuned to find out. And this could also make for some awkward situations, because this is when the grandkids find out which one is the favorites or that grandma has been having an affair with the pool boy all along.  I love you all equally, but Hofmeyr has abs of steel.  And look, I know there's going to be a run on octogenarians now, but if you ask me, we shouldn't need any more incentives to hang out with old people because old people are the best. They're full of wisdom. They usually have free candy in their pockets and they have lots of practical advice about defeating Nazis, which is super useful these days. But America isn't the only country taking creative measures to combat coronavirus. They're also making big changes in France, a.k.a. horny Belgium, where office culture may never be the same.  Employees in France will soon be allowed to eat at their desks at work. Currently, the French labor code actually prohibits businesses from allowing employees to eat meals in areas that are dedicated to work. But the Labour minister will be making the changes as part of new covid restrictions as employees return to the office. Now, it could signal a change for a country with a very strong work life balance, with one French woman telling The New York Times the amendment is, quote, a catastrophe.  I agree this is a catastrophe for French culture. First, they start eating up their desks. And what's next? Working up their desks. SLOCUMB Yeah, but this is kind of wild.  Apparently, up until now, it had been illegal in France to eat lunch at your desk because they think if it's allowed, workers are going to be pressured to do it instead of taking a lunch break. Not to mention it's really hard to get fresh ground pepper out of a keyboard. And I'm not going to lie. I was really surprised to learn about this rule. I mean, I would have thought that if anyone ate while they were working, it would be the French.  I mean, the main pastry doubles as a phone. Hello. Go left. I need those documents on my desk by the end of the day.  Ha ha ha ha. OK, magnifique. And finally, a story about some people in the Caribbean who were quarantining a little too well this morning, three Cuban nationals are recovering after being stranded on a remote, deserted island for five weeks.  The married couple and another man were found on Anguilla Key, a small island between Key West and the Bahamas.  We actually discovered them waving next to their temporary shelter that they built for themselves.  Pictures show the shelter the three had made with little food and water. They reportedly survived off rats and conch shells.  Good Lord, people, that sounds absolutely traumatic to be on a beach and not be able to Instagram it.  That is a punishment I wish on nobody. But yeah, that's right. A married couple and another man was stranded on an island.  Thirty three days. And the person I feel worse for is the other man because not only are you the third wheel, but once that rat supply dries up, you know, you the first thing on the menu while you guys, you guys looking at me like that, you guys want to have like a threesome, I mean something like that. But for real, actually being stranded on a tropical island seems way less fun than they made it seem on Gilligan's Island.  I don't remember ever seeing Marianne walking around covered in red blood. But let's move on to our top story, the second impeachment of Donald Trump, former president of the United States and current Mar a Lago toilet clogger.  Today was day three of the trial, and we'll catch you up on all of the latest in another episode of the magical, wonderful road to Impeachment.  No one will go to the beach.  That's probably presidential harassment.  So today was the final day of the Democrats presenting their case against Trump.  And one of the most shocking revelations of the presentation has been the never before seen footage of the riots, which showed us just how close some sentences came to meeting the world's worst to a group.  House impeachment managers used graphic new video and audio to recreate moments from the Capitol siege, and some of that footage showed just how close lawmakers and their staffers came to the pro Trump mob that stormed the Capitol.  Among the very close calls, this security video showing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer being escorted by his security detail, then quickly turning around after spotting nearby rioters. Another video shows Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman redirecting Senator Mitt Romney away from rioters just down the hall.  All right. That is terrifying. There were so many riots in so many parts of the capital, but these senators, which is running around like they were stuck in the weekend's HOF maze. And you can understand why Mitt Romney especially would be sprinting away from the small. But I mean, these are the people who were chanting hang Mike Pence, Mike Pence, the man who spent the last four years banging the back of Trump's head. So to them, Mitt Romney is basically Mormon AOC.  I mean, I don't know what Mitt would have done if he had run into them. He would have had to try and blend in with them.  Let's find these trainers. It's time to kill the cheapskate.  I hardly agree, my good friends. And afterwards, let's go to the local confectionary and enjoy some vanilla milkshakes.  What a great idea. This guy's all right.  But this isn't an impeachment trial of a few thousand insane Kuhnen followers. No, this is the impeachment of Donald Trump. So once again today, the Democrats focused on how Donald Trump incited the riots.  And what was really helpful was that the rioters themselves provided the evidence.  Even after the attack, the insurrectionists made clear to law enforcement that they were just following President Trump's orders.  They didn't shy away from their crimes because they thought they were following orders from the commander in chief.  Oh, no, no, no, no. It's out there in New York this week. First off, let's go jump. Yes, dude, dude, let's tell Trump what we're fighting for. Trump. Guys, come on.  Don't call Trump in the middle of the riots. You just saw him at the rally a couple hours ago. You got to be chill. You call the morning after the insurrection. You know, you've got to play the game also. How embarrassing is this for Trump? Even his supporters knew they can call him any time and he won't be busy. But overall, these videos make it pretty obvious that Trump incited the rioters. They were wearing Trump hats, carrying Trump flags, and they all just watched Trump speak and they were chanting Fight for Trump.  Even that dog from Blue's Clues is like, I need to challenge you guys. We will. We will. And we'll know what this is. Right. I mean, if one guy stormed the Capitol because he thought you said it to him, maybe you can just blame him.  But if an entire stadium of people misunderstood you in the exact same way, I don't know, man, that's just on you. But if there's one theme of this trial, aside from Trump being super guilty, it's Republican senators not caring that Trump is super guilty.  The new evidence and the dramatic recreation of the January 6th mayhem apparently did very little to sway most most of those Republican senators.  The jurors, some of them are explicitly not listening feet up on desks. They're reading books. They're reading briefing papers on other topics.  We are seeing more empty seats on the floor of the Senate. Our colleague Monterrosa was in the Senate chamber just a few moments ago.  He counted up to 15 empty seats while the Democrats were playing their video right. Or storming the Capitol. Handful of Republican senators, including Rick Scott, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, barely even looked at the screen, according to reports. And Rand Paul was looking down at a paper in his lap where he had begun doodling with a pencil.  OK, I'm sorry. That is so disrespectful. Hey, Rand Paul, why don't you show us what you were doodling instead of paying attention to the present? Oh, my God. It's beautiful. Wow, you you should have been an honest friend, you should these sentences are a jury for a trial of the president, but instead they're acting like bored middle schoolers. What did Democrats have to do to make this interesting for them, bringing one of those math teachers who wraps everything?  My name is Doug, and I'm here to say democracy was threatened in a major way. Booch.  So for many Republicans, there's nothing that could happen in this trial to change their minds, but if there's a Republican senator out there who's still struggling to ignore the evidence against Trump, well, good news.  We have just the products for you.  Are you a Republican senator feeling overwhelmed by overwhelming evidence, introducing impeach parts, the only headphones with evidence canceling technology so you can ignore even the loudest chants of Hang Mike Pence, impeach Pardes. Also drown out that little voice in your head that's disgusted with what you've become.  You've sold your soul, Josh. You're a chump. Plus, they were great in TV interviews. This election was not stolen.  Do you accept that fact? I think we have some audio problems right there in peach pods, what insurrection or you now get a free Michael to sleep through the rest of the trial and comfort.  All right. When we come back, Jordan Klepper goes back to D.C. to see what happened after the capital riots.  And Daniel Kaluuya is joining us on the show.  So don't go away.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show, this is the second time that Democrats have impeached Donald Trump and it raises the question, have they learned any lessons from the first time? Well, to find out, we sent Jordan Klepper down to Washington, D.C. for another episode of Fingers The Pulse.  It's impeachment week again, so I'm back in Washington, D.C., where our capital is a bit different from the last time I was here. It is hard to figure out how to get in towards the Capitol. I want to get to the capital gang. I went down the Constitution there, miles and miles of fences.  Somebody get on parler or something to figure out how to get in there.  And the thousands of screaming maiga folks is down to two.  What do you think of the impeachment if it wasn't the president who called the riots?  What I saw and what there's a lot of evidence showing is that many of the initial people who entered the building violently were leftist antifa. I was here.  It seemed like a lot of people were Trump supporters. A thousand people broke into the Capitol, erected a noose outside and tried to kill the speaker of the House and the vice president.  I literally think that you have added the tried to kill all those things then you have ignored. I got to show you some video. I got it. You want to trade videos because I'd love to share with you as well.  I'm not going to give you my email yet. The mugger faithful aren't the only ones who want to go to the video house.  Prosecutors plan to, quote, have a fast paced cinematic case.  Raschein is aiming for a blockbuster action film this week.  Yes, impeachment, too, is bigger and louder and more cinematic than the first one, because as we all know, when you're dealing with American audiences, stunning imagery goes farther than facts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about Jordan Klepper vs. Trump Supporters - The Complete Collection."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My mind is made up good enough for me. According to the mainstream media, Donald Trump's lewd talk and recent sexual assault allegations are eroding his Republican support.  The GOP is abandoning their nominee in droves.  The exodus of Republican support continued. Republicans are deserting the sinking ship. But I don't listen to that noise. I listen to this throb.  Bah bah bah bah. This is Jordan Klepper. Fingers the pulse. I hitched a ride to a rally in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania to ask Trump supporters if he had finally crossed the line. You know what?  So what if he wants to grant Putsy? I want to grant Poissy. That's a no. I wish I could grab as much pussy as he is.  Well, I'd like to grab Okita by a push and shove some Yankee Doodle Dandy right up your chest.  Also a no. But how were they OK with a presidential candidate bragging about sexual assault?  Wait for it I think is just locker room talk that really what does that guys in the bar talk that way when they see a pretty girl. What are going to say?  I've heard worse about men talking about girls, women.  So are they are you talking about other like presidential candidates like Mondale? Yes. Locker room talk. That's what boys do. He didn't do it. Well, I don't I don't talk like that. Well, do you have any children? I joke. Do they talk like that? No, they don't. Not those boys. Well, no. No, I don't. Does he talk like that? No. No. That boy. No. Is that how you talk?  Well, no. But I feel like he he says how your dad talks, you know, but your pastor talks. No, not to.  Who talks like that? Well, obviously, Donald Trump I was stupid bragging mentor.  Men brag. We brag. Right. You brag a bit, right? I'm not exactly. But I know quite a few people that do. And background. Dabb Yes. It was all becoming clear. Men brag. It's just locker room talk gravel y you can trump. What is it.  They're grab it away again. I thought I can't talk like in front of my daughter. You just did things you say people can hear and the locker room was huge extending all the way across the country. Was there any line Trump couldn't cross? Is there anything Trump could say that could come on up that would make you never know, no matter what he says or does?  I will vote for Donald Trump. If he said the N word, would you still vote for him? It wouldn't be right, but I would still vote for him.  What if he said everybody should go little pigs with that? Would you still vote for him?  That I would still vote for him? Yes. Wow. The media's fingers. We're nowhere near the polls. They have gotten it wrong. People here knew Trump's comments weren't sexual assault. They were something completely different. Just ask this man who conducted a highly scientific survey.  Carducci, I asked a lot of women here at half of them would love to have their pussy snatched right by Trump. I got news for you. That is news to me.  One man's sexual assault is another man's flirtation. You must be quite the charmer with the ladies. I used to be.  You know, I got the ring now. One of them landed me. She even squeezed it. So I can't get it off because she sort of I took it off once and it was a little mark there. So she's no dummy.  Oh, well, I think she's a dummy if she thinks somebody else is going to do. Sorry, bro. Just a little bit of locker room talk. This has been a divisive nightmare of an election, but in the spirit of moving forward, at one of the debates, the candidates themselves took an opportunity to say one positive thing about each other. I hitched a ride to a Trump rally to see if his supporters were also ready to rise above the anger and reach out to the other side.  And you say one nice thing about Hillary Clinton. Not really. Not no. Not one.  No, no. I have absolutely nothing nice to say about Hillary Clinton. What about people who support Hillary? I think they're idiots. No, I.  I'm sorry. I'd like to be a gentleman and say, yes, you get a nice kid, but she's a nice kid, right. I guess she hasn't proven herself to be guilty of anything yet. I'm sorry, Jordan. What can I tell you?  Obama, me, the man. Wow. That was depressing. So I headed to a Hillary rally. Surely her supporters would live up to their slogan of stronger together and teach those hateful Trump voters a thing or two about kindness. What do you like about Donald Trump?  Nothing. He's an asshole. Is there any good thing about Donald Trump that you could say? No, no, no. I'll give you time. OK, let me think.  No, you don't really think. Oh, yes. All right. No, you didn't. You changed your hair a little bit and then you said the same thing. He has an economic background.  OK, whether he can put it into a plan that will suit our nation, I don't know.  You don't stop. The first part was a nice compliment. You weren't loved. And that is the nice.  So both camps have a ways to go. Maybe they just needed a little push.  What if I gave you two dollars and you say something nice about Hillary Clinton? What if I gave you ten dollars? No. What if I told you it will help our society to put aside your partisanship and actually say something kind about somebody that half the country supports, not Hillary? I no.  No. OK, how about this? Democrats like expressing their feelings. Maybe that was the way it we're going to do I feel statement. Talk to Donald Trump. I want you to say when you blank, I feel blank.  When you say grab her by the pussy, I feel like a disrespected woman. OK, that's good.  When you say let's build a wall, I say let's build you into the wall because see what you did right there, you didn't feel what you did is you use that as an opportunity to be negative. Mm hmm. Now, that's something, you know, who would do something like that? Donald Trump, don't do this.  This wasn't working. I couldn't unite the people. Maybe I could unite their slogans. Wait, no, that's not it. Good. OK, better that can work.  Make a man make America stronger together, get clunky. But it a couple of works. Make America stronger together again. A little bit of both. Trump way to move forward. OK, let's trying to move us forward. Make America stronger together again. A little bit of both. You know what, it's bullet for Hillary. I don't think it's for us coming together. We'll be together. We're bound up in hell.  But then just when I gave up hope, I finally heard it. That one positive thing.  OK, well, there's got to be something good about Donald Trump. It's come over. Pretend your husband is Hillary Clinton. Say something nice. I like your hair. I mean, his hair is hilarious.  His hair is real nice hair. So if there's one thing we can all rally around as a country, it's great hair. God bless America. Not even a month since the campaign ended with victory. Donald Trump was getting the band back together again for something. The president elect planning to visit those states that helped him secure a win for the White House.  A Trump victory tour, a victory tour. Now, they tell us they want us to call it a thank you tour. They're calling it a victory tour. I mean, I don't think we've ever seen that before, calling it a thank you tourist. Right.  No one in the media or Trump's camp seems to know exactly what this event is. So I went to Cincinnati to find out what is this?  We know what we've got a bunch of people who are really excited about Trump. They said we're going to get tired of winning. We're not tired. He wants to let the people know that things are still going on. The stuff that he was still campaigning about, he's still going on.  I mean, it's it is it's obvious if he doesn't know when the campaign ends. That's right. What is it? Again, it's a victory to take another lap, right? Yeah. My one on how many of these rallies do you think you'll see in the first hundred days? I'm going to go with 15 because like the never ending to a never ending tour, we don't have to do it anywhere. We can just party all the time, all day long, all day long.  Someone going to run the country? Yeah, well, I just think the Trump matter is our president from Apprentice, the president. I love Ivanka Trump. It's incredible how you want to blow your brains out. It's so mind boggling neck. Jesus was right. This was a hell of a bash. While Trump has changed his tune on things like locking up Hillary and draining the swamp, these people were party like it was October twenty sixteen. They had their signs in their background tabs and they knew the lyrics to all the hits.  We're ready, we're ready. Yeah, build a wall, build a ball, drain the swamp, lock her up. We're going to lock her up, of course. Of course. Now, some people are saying she's a good person, should be prosecuted. They're liars. Well, that person is Donald Trump. That's wrong. At least we know Donald Trump's not going to stand for having Hillary's elitist New York bankers anywhere near the government.  None of the books except for bringing in some billionaire bankers.  It's going to happen. It's going to. Yeah, sure. Sure.  It's a some of them, I'm sure the Goldman Sachs guy, I mean, that is the swamp we want to drain. Sure. But also make secretary of the Treasury. Oh, yeah. The swamp will be drained.  Now, he does have people like Steve Manoogian who wants Goldman Sachs got to fill the swamp. You got to yeah. There's parts of the swamp. They're going to come in.  There's parts of the swamp that, you know, that's just not as catchy to say. So yeah, it's not. Yeah.  Don't you want the most qualified person, even though it might be a so-called, you know, swamp member, lobbyist or whatnot, that not the best thing to do. Somebody who's the most qualified for the job has the most experience, even if some of their background is suspect, that's the person who should have that job. That's right. A common sense way of looking at things. And that was, I think, Hillary Clinton's entire platform. The point is, instead of spending time learning how to run the country or following through on campaign promises, having a rally like this just feels so good.  The bottom line is we want to win big. I love you to look at this place. You're going to be happy, we're all going to be happy. And I was finally starting to see exactly what this was. It was a big, self-congratulatory pleasure fest in the round.  This is kind of our triumph. And so you guys wanted to, like, kind of get together in a big circular area and just kind of help each other release some of the tension and celebrate. Yes. Yes, exactly. It's important for you guys to just all come together at the same time. It's it's community. Yeah. It's a circlejerk, if you want to call it that. Sure. Yeah, it's a circlejerk. Well, good talking to you.  Just get ready, America. Your forearms are going to be you. Four years ago, I hit the streets to get the unfiltered truth from America's most engaged voters, trump that much. We don't even see the irony in it. Now we're heading into an historic election and I'm excited to get out into America and embed myself in the middle of the campaign trail. First up, rain soaked Hershey, Pennsylvania, but even Mother Nature couldn't dampen our spirits.  It's eight hours before Donald Trump arrives. It's raining and there are people here as it got good to see.  You can see I get guys excited when you're running for Congress. I bet you are. Good luck. Anybody can do it. A lot of familiar faces. Doris, Carol. Nice to be out there amongst my people once more. Let's go, guys. And here we go again.  Since my last Trump rally, there have been roughly 37 Marvel movies and one very combative impeachment trial, but what else has changed?  So what's new this season and everything? Honestly, we got this baby go to great America.  Keep watching it. It sounds like something Donald Trump would say or Yoda. I suppose they have very similar syntax. We're not all great speakers. Do you have any trump that bitch?  You don't have to know anything that's at all aimed at women, not for women, at women. What are you hoping for tonight?  I'm hoping Donald Trump is just in a good, good place of mine right now. I hope he talks about immigration. You're hoping for a better one? I'm hoping for a wall. Who's going to pay for it? He's going to pay for it. I say that's what we're going to find out. He's going to be taxpayer money. So maybe that's the who's going to pay for it. That's what we're going to find out about. Yeah. Why are you here?  Well, because two weeks ago I had a dream. And in that dream I was given this vision, this you had a screen printing dream. Your dream told you that Trump is going to win and then Ivanka and then Don Jr. and Eric Tippity is going to win in 2014. And then Baron. Great. All right. But it only serves one term. Oh, no, no. That's only one term. That's four years. Yeah. Actually, these are mostly one term president.  Oh, you're not reading it. Right, right.  No, I know this is one twenty four to twenty eight. That's more years and then another four.  No, no, no. That's, these are one term presidents ivonka one term Don Jr one term paper.  Ivanka what's what's the name. Ivonka is two thousand twenty four and two thousand twenty eight. That's eight years. That's four years.  You have a four year period. You, somebody else gets it right. It doesn't say anything about re-elected. Sanchez has her getting elected in twenty twenty four and twenty twenty method right now.  My math is that of course these rallies aren't just about spirited debate. It's also an opportunity for Trump supporters to clarify their message. In one word descriptor. Joe Biden, Dickless Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Warren scummy. Bernie Sanders Bolshevik. He Boutiette. Yeah, it's just a joke with the punch line. Who and trying to be politically correct here. But you know what I said. But I thought the word you're going to pick was vet people to judge people.  But that's two words. And I can't say the whole thing on camera. What's the whole thing? People will be, oh, it's homophobic.  That's why you can't say homophobia aside, there was one big new thing hanging over this rally, the impeachment.  What do you think about this impeachment bullshit? Well, shit. Why is it bullshit? Why? Because he didn't do anything.  It's bullshit. It's bullshit. Total bullshit. It's total nonsense.  And Trump has been grooming his supporters to push back on any impeachment talk.  With this simple demand, all you have to do is read the transcript, read the transcript, read the transcript. It's all about the transcript."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about India's Farmer Protest | Robin Roberts & Noah Centineo."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The largely peaceful campaign briefly turned violent last week when protesters drove a procession of tractors into the heart of the capital, New Delhi. Some farmers confronted police who fired back with tear gas. The government has arrested more than 120 people and charged farm union leaders with rioting and sedition.  Now the government's responding by using massive concrete barriers to box in the three main sit in sites along New Delhi's highways. It's also cut off electricity, water and the Internet.  Delhi police have deployed fifty thousand police and paramilitary personnel in and around the capital. There were extra drones flying over protest sites. They have erected thousands of iron nails on some of the roads leading up to some of the sites.  India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has broke his silence, describing violence in the capital, New Delhi, last Tuesday as an insult to the country. Modi says he will not change his mind on the new laws, but has repeated an offer to delay them for 18 months.  Hot damn that tractor was moving. It's like someone made a Grand Theft Auto mission in Animal Crossing. But look, clearly the government has decided that they've had enough of this protest because this is a major crackdown and maybe they think postponing the law will satisfy the farmer. But think about it, in 18 months, people will be in the same position that they are in now and the protests will happen all over again. I mean, you're basically just giving people 18 months to get angrier and soup up their tractors even more.  But you see, this crackdown shows you how worried the government must be about this protest. And honestly, they probably should be because it's clear that these farmers are digging in for the long haul.  Farmers say they're undeterred by the government's crackdown and will continue their protests until the agriculture laws are repealed.  Tens of lined the highway where farmers spend cold winter nights. Water tankers are brought in by tractors for bathing, cooking and cleaning. Medical boards have been set up to tend to the sick. Dozens of people, young and old, are busy cooking in community kitchens and serving meals is a makeshift mall, a roadside market selling jackets and coats.  Youngsters intermittently break the routine with song and dance atop tractors.  We've made this our home, whether it takes four years or. We're here to stay. Now, you see there, that's some determination right there, that dude is ready to protest for four years, which doesn't surprise me because nobody on earth is more patient than a farmer. Farmers of the same people who will wait five months to grow an eggplant and eggplant. I'm not even patient enough to find it in the Mojie. Sometimes I'll just send like a cucumber or something.  And, you know, if you ask me, it was especially smart of those farmers to build a mole inside their camp because think about it now. If the government sends in police officers, those cops automatically become more cops and lose all authority. Check, mate. So the next time you see Indian farmers trending, you'll have a little idea of what it all means. The government is trying to force the farmers back to their fields, but the farmers aren't giving up their demands and nobody knows how this thing is going to end up.  But I don't know if I may quote one of their prominent supporters. This protest might just work, work, work, work, work, work in this mountain. Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, bird. And if you don't know now you know. All right. When we come back, Robin Roberts is joining us on the show. And Noah Centineo is also going to be here. So stick around.  If you're like me and spend hours on Instagram scrolling past all the over filtered, perfect highlight reels of other women and just wish you had someone to commiserate with about your nightly shame spiral. I have great news for you. I'm Jay David and I'm the host of Tell Me About It. The weekly podcast is here to remind you that the women we constantly compare ourselves to, yes, even that one also have lives that are far from perfect, whether it's admitting all the times you've texted your ex navigating the world of fertility treatments or feeling like the only one in the room with depression, nothing quite compares to the relief you feel when another woman admits they've said exactly where you are and lived to tell the tale.  So cancel that zoom happy hour. You know, you didn't want to go anyway and come hang with me as I talk to women, I respect about all the insecurities, mistakes and the heartbreaks that they don't normally post about on Instagram.

Listen to tell me about it with Jada on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  Hey guys. Been both here and I'm the creator of a crazy little show called BLAW Concern for Comedy Central Digital.  And I'm Krista Freeman's boss, the voice of Clarkson, whose name is Well, Son, we made this insane show at the studio that makes robot chicken.  Markinson is a mixed media puppet show that follows an overly manly father named Blac, who desperately tries to connect with his overly nerdy son.  He got some really cool people involved. Justin Rowland, Donald Faison, Jane Lynch, Jim Rash, Debra Baker, Jr.. It's a really fun show that we're really proud of, and it's available right now on Comedy Central's YouTube channel. So go check it out. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Good Morning America's very own Robin Roberts. We talked about her new special about the Tuskegee Airmen returning to the studio after broadcasting from home and who the greatest NFL players of all time.  Robin Roberts, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  It's it's it's a pleasure to be here.  Many people know you as the face of Good Morning America. You have been the face of America's institution for an extremely long time. But a lot of people may not know that you were the face of Sports Center for 15 years and you covered the NFL for an extremely long time. So I would like to know from you the most important question that is plaguing America right now. Is Tom Brady the greatest of all time? All.  Oh, come on. Give me something hard. That's a softball. You start with me. That's a softball. I he's the goat. OK, ok. No, no, no. Fine.  I'll give you a hug one. Robert, is Tom Brady the greatest athlete of all time? See that that's OK. That's harder. Is he the greatest athlete of all time? You know what? That's debatable. I love me some Serena Williams. Twenty three Grand Slam titles won when she was pregnant. Try that, Tom Brady.  OK, you win. You win a Super Bowl while pregnant. Maybe maybe we'll talk, you know, but it's fun to have this argument. And I'm just glad to in my lifetime to have seen to be seeing someone like that too high. Michael Jordan, to be seeing Serena Williams. I mean, we've had some great, great athletes during our time, but he is he is special.  You've always shown love to the team that you work with on camera. Every single morning we wake up with you. We enjoy watching you. What has it been like doing the show from home now? Because a lot of your show is about that chemistry that you share in person.  It really is. And I got to tell you, I've got some great teammates at GMA, Michael Strahan, who's at home now because he was diagnosed with covid-19. Yeah, fine, thank goodness. But now he's broadcasting from home for time. George had to do the same. I did it for the longest. I was at home seven months. And my PA duesler, my Darlow, my girlfriend, Amber, helping out. That was really difficult.  It was really challenging to keep that that chemistry when you have like a two second delay, you know. But more than that, it's just. But I have to say, Trevor, what I came back into the studio in September, man, it is like I can't describe the feeling. And I know it's a feeling that a lot of people are going to have once they can get back to their workplace. We've never been better. We've never been more in sync.  You've been the face that has guided America through crises. You've been there to share some of the most fun stories. But this new project that you're embarking on might be my favorite Robin Roberts project. Yet it's about the Tuskegee Airmen and it's entitled Legacy of Courage. And what I love about it is not that you're telling the story, but your connection to the story. Tell me how this all came to be, please.  Their legacy is so broad, fighting fascism abroad and then racism back here at home. My father, Colonel Lawrence Roberts, was a Tuskegee airman at the age of 19. He got on a segregated train train to be a pilot. What they did in World War Two, what the Tuskegee Airmen, a.k.a. the Red Tails, because they had to pay their tails so they would know because they escorted bombers and they need to know that they were friendlies that was escorting them like that Exupery flying record that they had and that they had to fight for that.  Right. Thank Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a first lady at the time with down the Tuskegee. Can you imagine this went down to Tuskegee in the 40s, got in a plane with a black man, flew with them and said, all right, let them go. And so then they were able to go and actually be in combat before they could just train, but they couldn't fight. And now they want to do was fight for their country like everybody else at that time.  I've often seen I've often seen the story of of the Tuskegee Airmen as as myth. It's African-American myth and it's beautiful. It's like these legends and these heroes. But this story takes us through a different journey about how they were fighting just to get the military to accept black service members, just to get the American public to accept black service members. It was a challenge that we really take for granted when you just seeing the accolades that they achieved now.  And that's why it's so important that people watch this film, because we take you there. All they wanted to do was fight for this country. They wanted to fly. And when they came back from the war, it wasn't as heroes. They came back and after all they had done, they were told back of the bus, you're second class citizen. And they fought to.  Integrate the military and also many of them became very, very much a part of the civil rights movement at the time. Really gave us as as as as the public a framework to go like, oh, my gosh, you know, they were challenged that they didn't have the intellect to fly. But you know what? They showed that excellence and, yes, black excellence can beat adversity of all types. And that's the kind of message that they said, too, to so many people back here in the US.  There's no denying that in America there is the dichotomy that many black people face when they say, I love this country, and yet it feels like this country does not love me in return. From your father's perspective and being his daughter and seeing how he navigated this paradox, what do you think we can learn from that journey and how to, I think, have the conversations in and around patriotism and still challenging America to be better to its citizens?  Thank you for using the word patriotism. My father was a patriot, a true patriot, and that's all he ever said, he would talk about how he felt freer in the air than on the land as a black man in this country. And I think it's very timely, given what we went through in twenty twenty. The racial reckoning, seeing all black, white, taking to the streets and saying, no more, no more. It was really and I think this is why this film is so timely, because, yes, we go back and we show their legacy, but we also bring it to today.  You see how they impacted the Barack Obama himself said they were an example to him that propelled him into public service. So I think when we watch a film like this, we're reminded of our history and it lets us know why am I taking to the streets? And yes, some things we're still fighting for something similar that we're fighting for that they did as well. It's heartfelt.  It's wonderful. And I can see why, because of the story and the and the history that you share with one of those airmen and I guess the story of all of them combined. Robin Roberts, thank you so much for joining me on the show.  Next time I'm going to wear a hoodie, going to bring it back on the show. I'm going to be OK. Don't do that to America, Robin. You do that to America. I beg you, do not do that to America.  Thank you, Trevor. Take care. Tuskegee Airmen Legacy of Courage will premiere February 10th on the History Channel. Make sure to catch it. All right. When we come back, Netflix star and heartthrob Noah Centineo talks to me on the show about the final installment of Tooele.  The boys you don't want to miss. It's.

Earlier today, I spoke with Noah Centineo, star of the hit Netflix franchise to all the boys. We talked about his journey from playing romantic hero to superhero and so much more. Noah Centineo, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Glad to be here. Very. I mean, is this even social distancing of where I even in the same room, this is like telemetric distancing. It's not.  I think it's the ultimate form of social. This is the furthest distance that you can do socially to be.  Yeah, it's like a social distancing.  I like that's that's exactly what is this like a Noah thing or just Noah's growing their hair. Is that what's going on right now.  I suppose I suppose if you pull your eyes it's probably. Oh yeah.  Mine can go. Yeah, yeah. It can go all the way. I try and keep it like just you know, it depends on the day. I just, I just, you know, it's, I get it. It's this is a feeling.  Yeah. Yeah it is a feeling. But welcome to the show. I wanted to have you on for a while, not for anything professional just because I'm a fan. You know, I, I grew up watching rom coms like there was like a period in my life when rom coms with the best possible movie that you could watch, like in the cinema or at home, and then all of a sudden rom coms weren't cool.  And then I had to act like I didn't like them. And then to all the boys came along and then yourself and Lana, just you took me back to a time that I that I forgot. I enjoy it as much as I did. Laura Jean and Peter Kravinsky have this magic on camera, but I feel like yourself in line to have it off camera as well. You have this vibe about you as people. It's like, you know, because we live in an age now where back in the day movie stars were movie stars and that was it.  You see them otherwise."}]}

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. One of the big rallying cries of the Black Lives Matter movement has been defund the police.  But what does that mean? Well, a city in Oregon has offered one vision for what it might look like. Roy Wood Jr. has more.  In twenty 20, thousands of people marched in the streets trying to defund the police, which sounds scary, but what does it actually mean?  This really is a an idea to entirely reimagine public safety and rethink how we do it.  It means taking money out of police budgets and using it to fund different types of workers who handle some nine one one calls, kind of like how Batman had to take a pay cut to fund the Justice League. And in Eugene, Oregon, they're giving it a trial run with a program called Kahootz. Good. What is it like? A Crime Solving Owl is an acronym. It stands for Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Street. OK, so no, I sit down with Kahootz coordinators Tim Black and Ebony Morgan to find out how the little test project has been going.  So I'm guessing you guys started Kahootz a few months ago when everybody was marching in the streets?  No, we've actually been around for more than 30 years.  Wait 30 years. When your organization was created, the fresh prince had left for Bel Air yet, OK, they've been doing this for a while.  But what exactly are they doing?  What type of nine one one calls do you all typically respond to as a Kahootz agent?  Is it Agent Kahuta Hooty?  We respond to non-criminal and nonviolent calls for service that come through the number one line in our area and we respond with a crisis worker and an EMT instead of law enforcement.  You say that guns the right no guns, no tasers, no pepper spray and gun and checks. And then just also a baseball bat.  Why is it that we assume it's going to take a weapon to get somebody up off of you?  I hear what you're saying to him. But like, even more cops got mace and they protect him. Build-A-Bear Workshop.  But where other law enforcement officers are utilizing more and more expensive military gear to loosen a little white vans actually save a ton of money compared to the local police's annual budget of ninety million.  Kahootz cost about two million, around two percent of the police budget.  But Kahootz respond to almost 20 percent of emergency calls. What is a typical Kahootz call look like?  It's really about meeting people where they are and helping them get to a space that may be a little safer than we started talking on the side of the road. And it's noisy and you're overwhelmed.  Let's just have a seat in the back of the van and then we'll talk about nothing but kidnap anybody, not if they expect speculators get anything. I do promise people snacks if they get in something. What kind of snacks you got granola bars, some water, whatever. We'll have clothes on the van, tents, sleeping bags.  I'm going just be honest. You had me a snacks. I'm a 40 year old man. I'll get a van for some snacks.  But besides the granola bars, they have one big secret weapon just being chill, using a technique they call de-escalation.  The escalation of the practice where you're encountering somebody who is escalated and you help them get to a desolated space or a little more calm.  So what's the deescalated version of pepper spray like Tabasco sauce?  You just flicked it in somebody that, oh, no, I need to be engaged. I show you that I really care about the things that you're saying and finding that way that we can work through this crisis together.  But lately, kahunas have been putting their lives on the line, responding to teret America's angriest, most dangerous demographic.  And we get a lot of calls that are placed to public safety with a certain outcome in mind.  This say racism to the safe place. All right.  We have a lot of people that, you know, we do encounter situations where. Folks are calling in, you know, because of racist motivations or, you know, because they have a bias against different socioeconomic circumstances and in those situations, I think there are two things that we need to do.  One is we need to recognize what it was that triggered that person to make that call and that if they're going to slap the shit out of them or, you know, maybe try and present an opportunity for them to confront a little bit of their white fragility, a little bit of their explicit bias, I was going to say that next.  But then also at the other end with the individual that we are called out to respond to, you know, we have an obligation to say, hey, like this, this was unfair. We know that you didn't ask us to be here. We're here now. Is there anything that we can do for you?  So essentially, Karen calls now on one for protection from the homeless person and then y'all pull up and protect the homeless person from care, basically, and then all from Snax, that Kahootz is out there helping the homeless and in Cairns.  But I had to see it in action in a coveted safe way, of course, without leaving my home. You are the cops.  Technically, I can't get a hold of the police, but I would only do so if somebody was unsafe. And I'm not necessarily seeing someone say I'm safe right now.  I was so scared that Martin Luther King Jr. statue across the street has been staring at me. Can I say something to it, please?  Well, maybe I'm here to talk with you right now, though. And how long has this been going on for you?  Every day. Every day I come down the street and it's just a black guy and he's just staring at me. Where are the cops? Wish your gun was all of his stuff.  I don't see a threat. The immediate situation. Do you feel like that? You don't right now. I bet you don't. I bet you know him.  You people. What if he walks down a different block? What if you put the statue in a different place?  OK, we're not in charge of statue placement, but I am here to help you have a better day. And if this is going to ruin your day, you don't have to look at it.  Wow, these guys are good. And if Kahootz could do all of this with two million dollars, imagine what they could do with 90.  Incredible.  Thank you so much for that, Roy. When we come back, former NFL star turned actor Nnamdi Asomugha is joining me on the show to talk about his new movie on prime video.  Stick around. Lancaster, South Carolina, is in the middle of not much, but growing up nearby. I knew it as the hometown of a black man named Jim Duncan, who became a Super Bowl hero after the 15th. And now my new podcasts return man.  I'll discover that his death still makes no sense at all. The story was that my brother went to the police station, took a gun off a police officer and shot himself in the head. Most people don't believe that. For the past three years at the Rock Herald, I looked back at a story that's timelier than ever breaking down. So have you got some time to talk?  It involves race, the mental state of the person and a child that was scared to death.  The safe return man coming January 26 on the I Heart radio at Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast. If you took away the date and time, could you imagine that happening today? Yes, you can. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Nnamdi Asomugha. He's one of the best defensive players ever to play in the NFL, and now he's crushing it in a new career as an actor and producer. We talked about his new film and so much more.  Nnamdi Asomugha, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you for having me.  The last time I saw you was in person in the studio. I have not seen you since I would see you. Sometimes at events you would be the arm candy on your wife, Kerry Washington's. How are you how are you coping with this pandemic?  Yeah, these are the events that I would see that I would go as the support more than I've always the support at those events. But we're doing fine. It's a year into it now, almost. So the new normal is in. I think we're sort of rolling with the punches at this point. Right.  I feel I feel like though everyone's finding their few, you know, just just moments of joy, like I know I do that I. I wait for sporting events. I wait for special events. I wait for a movie to be released. That's why I get so excited whenever a new movie comes out, because we just we don't get to watch movies anymore. We don't get to go and have dinner. We don't get to live as much life.  And so before we get into your own movie that's on Amazon Prime, which is getting rave reviews, I wanted to talk to you about the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  You know, Tom Brady up against Patrick Mahomes is like the young versus the old, like the one of the greatest of all time, if not the greatest up against a future greatest possibly. Where's your money?  Oh, that's the question that yeah. I want to make it interesting.  I thought we were going into strategy and like, no, I just want to know, where's your money first? Where's your money?  I mean, I don't know how at age forty three you could ever bet against Tom at this point. It's like every time I mean there's always a point midway through the season where every single person that's talking about Tom Brady says he's done something for the last ten years that's always happened. And then he ends up in a Super Bowl at the end. So I don't know how you bet against him.  Let's talk about your second career, though. You know, not many people can, I think, move as effortlessly as you have from the world of sports at the highest level to the world of acting at the highest level on Broadway. People were blown away by your performance, you know, and then when you moved in front of the camera, people were amazed at how you just you just seem to effortlessly, effortlessly move from one script to the next from one roll to the next.  All these love is no different. You start opposite Tessa Thompson and a love story for the ages in a time where we're not used to seeing black leads together, you know, when it's not a story about oppression or slavery or or civil rights, it's a story about love. Yeah. What do you think has been the biggest reason for your success in this in this world? How have you managed to be that vulnerable coming from like the NFL?  Thank you for all of it and thank you for calling it success, because in my head, it's it's just always a work. So you never really know where you are. You just know that you have to keep going. But I don't know. I think I've realized that I'm a risk taker and I say because I just happen to love things that I'm not going into it saying I can't wait to take this risk. I just happen to love things that require me to take a risk in order to achieve them.  But I don't know. I think it's important to have no idea what you're doing and just go for it anyway. A lot of times in life, I think there's a beauty in that level of risk, I think at the end of the day. You're either going to succeed or you're going to grow, and I think both of those are a win, so why not go after it? And so that's what I've done. And and luckily, it's it's been working out and I've been able to sort of build from that.  It seems like in some ways your character has some of those those traits, you know, because you play a character who's a jazz saxophonist who's coming up trying to get his career off the ground. You know, you've got this woman who adores you and loves you and encourages you to be more. But she's doing her thing as well. It feels in many ways like the slivers of your life in this. And at the same time, you're playing a completely foreign, different character, first of all.  Is it true that you you spent a year learning how to play the saxophone before this role? I did. Yeah, I did. I mean. We had time, we took the script around town and we got passed on so often, but from time that we took it around was about a year and a half or so before we actually shot. I didn't know if that first group was going to say yes. So I needed to start playing the saxophone like they said no.  And it took a year and a half or so. But I just continued playing because you never really know what that moment is going to be when someone is going to say, yes, we'll make your movie. So I just kept playing and playing. I fell in love with it and fell in love with it. And I was able to then step on it and really not only play, but have fingering and everything down just so that it could it could be real.  Was that was there a point when you wondered if you now are just playing the saxophone for no reason because I mean, there's no guarantee the script will get picked up. There's no guarantee that a movie will get made. So now there you are, just like in the house. And at some point people are like, oh, you play the saxophone. In the beginning, you're like, yes, it's for my movie."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Recounts Capitol Riot Attack | Ibram X. Kendi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, they do this shit all the time. In fact, let's take a look at a few examples, starting with a scam one big bank pulled just a few years ago.  The New York Times reporting over the weekend that Goldman Sachs is running a scheme to artificially inflate aluminum prices.  An aluminum warehouse controlled by Goldman Sachs holds the equivalent of a quarter of the annual North American demand for the metal, but only offloads or distributes a required minimum of three thousand tons a day. No more, no less. Whatever the demand, pushing prices of the metal higher even as demand is declined. Goldman profits from this practice two ways.  First, from the extended rents paid to store the metal, and second, by the bets made on aluminum futures by its trading arm.  The inflated aluminum pricing by Goldman and other financial players has cost American consumers five billion dollars over the last three years.  Yeah, that's right. Basically, Goldman Sachs manipulated the supply of aluminum by only letting out a little bit at a time, you know, the same way Daniel Day Lewis limits the supply of movies isn't I mean, the dude's only been in six movies over the past twenty years. The Rock made that many movies yesterday. Get to work. Danny, by the way, for the rest of the segment, I'm going to be pronouncing its aluminum, even though the correct pronunciation is aluminium.  But we had a vote and all the people I work with our American. And so they won and I didn't want to accept the election result. But then I was like, no, we don't do that again. And I'm sorry, guys, but aluminum should never be hoarded. It needs to be used the way God intended to make condoms for robots or for Marjorie Taylor Green to wear as a hat. And believe it or not, Goldman Sachs got away with the scheme for years until people caught onto it.  So I guess you could say that their aluminum plan. Was foiled, wow, brown, brown, brown. Now, as crazy as this is, it's actually a common tactic with Wall Street. You take over a market and then manipulated supply to drive up the price. Like how JP Morgan used its control over electricity to fleece California.  JPMorgan Chase accused of manipulating energy prices and so driving up the electric bills of millions of Americans that night when energy prices are very low, essentially, they would bid them up so that in the morning the companies would go to buy energy and find the prices artificially high, takes a few hours to get a power plant going. So they would have to buy the energy in the morning when it was very, very expensive. In one case, JPMorgan duped California utilities into paying nine hundred ninety nine dollars per megawatt hour when the going rate was only twelve dollars.  Yo, this shit is crazy. It's like these guys were sitting around a table like I'm tired of just abusing our power metaphorically. Let's do it for real. Basically, because of JPMorgan, the cost of electricity went up from twelve dollars per megawatt to almost a thousand dollars per megawatt. Even Amish people were like, Yo, I don't even know what electricity is, but that shit is messed up. I hope the Amish community doesn't come off to me on Twitter for that one.  I mean, at that price, I would actually be less upset if you jumped me and robbed me. At least then it feels like you had to work for it. And the truth is, this isn't something hedge fund people are ashamed of. In fact, some of them even brag about it on the TV.  Jim Cramer once made a fortune running a successful hedge fund. He went on to host his own TV show, Mad Money, that offers stock tips to investors. But as Cramer has found out lately, a lot of Americans are mad at him. This video, made in 2006, has suddenly gone viral. Cramer explains to his own financial website, The Street Dotcom, how he could influence stock prices up and down as the manager of a massive hedge fund.  You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money, but it's a fun game and it's a lucrative game. I would encourage anyone who's in the hedge fund to do it because it's legal and it is a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that.  But I didn't care. These people got no shame, no shame. Zero, nada, zilch. He's just out here boasting about his evil plans. I mean, the only people who do that are hedge fund guys and bond villains. I mean, listen to him, listen to him talk about it. It's legal and it's very satisfying. Just as a general rule, whenever you have to remind someone that something is legal, it's probably shady.  You know, no one's ever like, hey, Trevor, you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory? It's legal.  But when it comes to hurting people in order to make a buck, nothing compares to the Great Recession of 2008, which was caused by guess who?  Wall Street manipulating the markets during the hot housing market, banks took millions of home mortgages, many held by people who could not afford them and bundled them into packages as mortgage securities. JPMorgan today admitted that it sold those packages to investors, even though its executives knew that many of the mortgages were highly suspect. When the market collapsed, those packages became mostly worthless.  Goldman sold investors subprime mortgage packages, but then made its own bet those same investments would lose value without telling investors. Goldman employees themselves use profanity to disparage the deals.  Boy, that Timberwolf was one deal.  And when asked if any of the executives at least felt partly responsible for the financial collapse, there's things that we wish we could have done better in hindsight or even regret.  Regret to me means something that you feel like you did wrong. And I don't have that.  When you hear your own employees or read about those in the emails, do you feel anything? I, I think that's very unfortunate to have on e-mail. Are you and and very unfortunate. I don't email to. Please don't take that feeling that way. I think it's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that God damn even the crowd.  Do you see them? Even the crowd in the chamber was like, oh, you know how bad you have to screw things up to turn a Senate hearing into a Jerry Springer taping. But this is how you know, how psychotic these guys are. Not only did they tank the economy, but they talk about emotions like they're serial killers. Do you regret hurting these people? Regret is a thing that one feels when one has done something wrong.  I mean, how can you expect these guys to change their behavior when they can't even express their remorse? The closest was. Street comes to reflecting is doing Coke off of a mirror. So after all the damage Wall Street has done to people's lives, please miss me with all of this whining about how unfair it is for Reddit to boost GameStop. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all these guys are heroes, but I will say it has been fun watching how some of the people who got rich off of GameStop have been spending their money.  While GameStop has minted plenty of millionaires, many retail investors are using their more modest profits to pay bills.  One Reddit user even posting that he paid off his student loan debt thanks to the money he's made off of GameStop the last few days.  Ten year old Jaden Carr. Two years ago, his mom bought him 10 shares of GameStop as a Kwanzaa gift. Back then, they were six dollars each. Now he sold them for more than three thousand dollars. What are you going to do with the money that you've made on GameStop?  I am already saying two thousand two hundred fifty thousand.  The best hunter can cashed in on the GameStop phenomenon last week, but didn't just cash in for himself. He used some of the money he made to donate six Nintendo switches and games to the children's hospital in Minnesota.  One day trader who cashed in on the craze walked into a GameStop store this week and started handing out hundred dollar bills to employees.  After the Robinhood app halted trading on GameStop, one investor chartered a plane to fly a banner over the company's headquarters saying, Suck my nuts, Robinhood.  Oh, that's a gangsta move right there. It's like Twitter, but in the sky now, you could say it's childish to spend money you took from Wall Street to dunk on Wall Street.  And that may be. But in the words of Jim Cramer, it's legal and very satisfying. All right. When we come back, Ibraham Kennedy will talk about African-American history that you might have missed. If you're worried, your friend may be struggling. Remember, you don't have to be there to be there. You can say how you will get a fake tattoo. You get asked if it works for you.  You could chat on a game, kick off your flip flops. You can ask on your couch while you're binge watch, whatever, whatever you do to reach out to a friend about their mental health, learn how you can help out.  Sees the awkward dog brought to you by the Ad Council, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Jed Foundation.  Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Professor Ibrahim Scandi. He's a historian who you might know from his award winning book, How to Be an Anti-racist. We talked about his new anthology of African-American history and so much more.  Professor Kennedy, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  It's great to be back on the show. Yeah, it's good to be back for you. But technically, the last time I saw you was in the studio and a lot has changed since then. I mean, not just the fact that people at home, but the fact that America has seen so many changes.  And yet some may argue America has seen so much more of the same. Your book goes to The New York Times best sellers list during the protests. And what many people gravitated to in your work was how you laid steps out for people to engage in anti-racism. Tell me a little bit more about that and firstly, why you felt it was necessary to lay out the steps and the tools that people could use and why it's so important to be anti-racist as opposed to just not being racist when racial inequity and injustice is normal.  If you do nothing, what's going to happen to that normality? It's going to persist. And so I really wanted to encourage people to actively challenge racism, but also to to realize there's a direct opposite to notions of racial hierarchy, and that's notions of racial equality, which are anti-racist ideas. There's a direct opposite to policies that lead to maintain racial inequity, and that's anti-racist policy. So so we can be creating a different type of America with different types of policies and different type of ideas.  A lot of people love your work because you delve into the past and you tie it to the present. This project is really special.  Because you are editing a book about the history of being African-American. And yet, instead of just looking at it through the lens of one person, one author, one story teller, you've gone with multiple stories, just everyone from every walk of life who fought for black freedom in America, from the slave trade all the way through to the current day. Tell me why you thought you could really tell a story that has been told so many times in a different way.  Why do you think I'll jump on this project to edit this book?  Well, I mean, with the four hundredth anniversary or birthday of a black America approaching. I think we wanted to figure out a new way to tell. Black, black, America's history, we wanted a new way to commemorate this moment, and one of the oldest racist ideas is this idea that we're a monolith, that that there is not incredible diversity within black America. And also African-American history has traditionally been written by a man, oftentimes a black man.  And so I think with those two things, we really wanted to bring together a community to write the history of a community, an extremely diverse community. And I think that's one of the things we're most proud about in terms of this book, just the diversity of blackness within the book and even the ordinary and extraordinary characters we share.  When you look at those stories, do you ever wonder what your dream is for the end goal? Sometimes I'll be talking to friends who will say, what is your definition of white privilege? And I say, just for me personally, I go for me, white privilege is you have the opportunity to fail on your behalf and succeed on your behalf and your behalf alone. If a white man launches a rocket to the moon, that's what he did. If a white man shoots up a school, that's what he did.  If a black person launches a rocket to the moon, then I mean, these niggas be launching rockets, you know what I'm saying? And so I wonder what your idea is. As a professor who studies race, what do you what are you hoping that we get to? What place do you hope to see us achieve? Well, it's it's ironic you speak about that individuality, because I think in the introduction to 400 Souls, I wrote about how we're not able as black people to be individuals.  Right. And so certainly for me, that would be an end goal. But I also think, you know, justice you know, equal justice for all peoples. You know, just something as simple as when I see a member of public safety or a police officer or whatever we would have in the future. I don't feel scared, you know, when I haven't done anything wrong. I'm not going to to to certainly feel scared or something. Like I walk into a place to to apply for a job.  And I don't have to look twice at what I'm wearing and how I'm going to speak, because that's not really going to matter, especially if I have the qualifications.  I've always wondered, you know, when I traveled the world, I was you know, I've been lucky enough. My comedy would take me to different countries. I was always intrigued by how black people specifically would be treated differently when they would not the black of that country, you know, like black Americans would come to South Africa. And oftentimes it was shopkeepers or just people in the street. They'd be like, oh, you're a black American. Very, very different.  And sometimes even Africans from other African countries would come and be treated differently. The same, I would notice, in America. Is that something in the story of race that is also tied to the history of how the country has treated the people of that race in the country?  I think so. I think race and racism is simultaneously global and national. In other words, you can see similar trends across the world.  But each of those trends, each of those policies and each of those racial constructions are distinct to the nation. But what's also consistent is pretty much every nation in the world argues that they're not racist towards.  Yeah, you see that across the board, whether it's the South African apartheid government or through to the US, no matter who it is, people go like, no, no, no, no, we're not racist. We just do these racist things to these people. There's there's a new administration in the White House. Many people feel like this is a new opportunity for America. Joe Biden has said on multiple occasions that racism is going to be at the forefront of his agenda, which has drawn him a lot of criticism.  What would you hope that he would do actually do that could move America forward in achieving that racial equality? Well, one thing he's doing with the coronavirus is he's he continues to say that he's going to put science before politics. And so as it relates to racial inequity and injustice, if he was to put silence science before politics, if he was to essentially look at what scholars are saying, how we can eliminate inequities and injustices, how we can reduce or eliminate police, not necessarily be as concerned about white swing voters or even Republican voters, that I think he would be able to make some serious advances in rooting out racism."}]}

Right. And that's the that's the that's the fundamental fallacy. We want to equality brings people together last night.  Well, I will say this. It will always be a journey. It will always be a challenging one. But having somebody like you and people like you who are writing some of the most amazing works to help us figure it all out, I think helps every single day.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the beginning of a Trevor Noah podcast about ICYMI - Eli Saslow and Derek Black on Redemption After Renouncing Racism in Rising Out of Hatred."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're listening to Comedy Central now. It was up in Queensland this week on Queensland's Supreme, we're getting cozy with the legend Mariah Carey and intimate two part episode.  Nobody knew who I was and they introduced me. Ladies and gentlemen, Columbia recording artist Ronnie Charity. And then at the end of it, he announcer he's like Nobelists.  Now, as we listen to Koslov Supreme on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast.  So welcome to the show.  I'm going to jump straight into it because this is honestly one of the most fascinating stories I've ever come across. I remember an op ed you wrote about it, but I must start with you, Eli. How do you decide to write the story? How do you even believe the story? And where do you start in saying, here's a former white nationalist? When did you start learning about Derek?  So I was writing about Dylann Roof, who committed the hate murder of nine people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, historically black church. And he'd spent a lot of time on the site called Stormfront. So I went on the site to try to learn about him, learn about this community. It's the largest hate site in the world. And there were certainly threads on there saying really upsetting things about what Dylann Roof had done, celebrating him. But the biggest thread was about somebody named Derrick Black, who was the son of the founder of this board.  David Duke's godson had been raised to sort of lead this ideology and then had disavowed it and sort of disappeared. And so I wanted to find him and I did.  So you're looking for a man by the name of Derrick Black who people are saying on the site is the basically the mastermind behind this ideology, someone who's inspired them. When you're reading through these threads and ideas, you say hate, but like, what are we specifically speaking about?  Well, in Derrick's case, we're talking about somebody who is on the radio every day. He had a radio show every day talking about anti-immigration talking points, talking about spreading false information about IQ scores with different races. And white people were smarter. And we're talking about somebody in Derek's case who had already run for office in Florida, spreading this kind of information and been elected and had risen to a position of power and then had written a letter later on to the Southern Poverty Law Center unwinding all of these talking points, all of the reasons he'd had the facts totally wrong and trying to convince other people that these conclusions were disastrous for the future of the country.  Now, Derrick, I mean, on your side, you have a really interesting story. You know, a lot of the time people will say nobody's born racist.  But I feel like you are one of the few people who's closest to this place because.  Oh, because I mean, your mom was married to David Duke. You know, you were born into a family of the Ku Klux Klan.  So from the very beginning, you were taught to think a certain way. How do you even begin the journey of starting to think differently? I didn't know until I was at college. I spent my all the younger years getting more more involved and feeling I really needed to help push this as my rights were getting older. And it wasn't until this weird experience of being outside of that in this different environment and seeing people who were not supposed to fit into my ingroup but who I really liked.  And we were hanging out and and also a college community that really condemned everything I was saying. And I wanted to know. First thing I want to know is why do you condemn it so strongly? Like, I think it's fine. It's not attacking anyone.  You so you genuinely believe these ideas, like just when you are alone in your room by yourself, you went like, I believe this. I believe that black people have lower IQ as I believe that people cannot mix.  I believe like you, this was like your truth. The whole sections of white nationalist organizations that spend their time putting out journal papers, putting on articles, putting out things that seem very scientific, that make a lot of sense, misusing statistics and misusing facts and making a case for all this just being the unfortunate truth that people don't want to believe. So you go to college, you meet kids who are not like you. Do you come in with your manhood or do you like.  I genuinely, genuinely want to know. Like how like did you or did you disguise your identity as a person? Was that was that how you started working in this world?  I didn't disguise it since I was a kid. From the time that I was a little kid, I was very aware that it was controversial and I just didn't bring it up in anything that was not the white nationalist conference world. And as I got older, it became harder and harder to have two parts of my life. And before college, everybody who I was doing stuff with that was not white nationalist, just sort of said, you know, I don't like that a lot, but what am I going to do?  Let's hang out. And it was college was the first time where I had this community that said, this is disgusting. We do not accept this at all. I'm not going to just let this pass.  So you have all of this information at hand, but when do you actually start changing? Because, I mean, like you say, you have people who oppose you. You know that people oppose you. But like Eli, when you when you're following the story, like, what do you find as someone who's observing from the outside, started to change somebody's mind and what they believed was right.  I think one of the things for me about reporting this book was learning how hard it is to affect that kind of change. I mean, from students on this campus, it took two years of sustained activism and engagement with Derek in order to begin to even see some kinds of results of a change in that civil resistance on campus, shutting down the school at one point to sort of say these beliefs are not OK, you don't belong here. It was people reaching out to him, people who were the victims of his prejudices, who invited him over for dinner, sat with him again and again and again and again, even when they weren't seeing change, just hoping that maybe Derek would go beyond the stereotypes and start encountering the humanity beyond beyond what he believed.  And it took a long time.  It sounds like like a process and also sounds like it's extremely unrealistic for it to be a process that works for everyone, because you would need every single person who believes in these ideas to be engaging with people who are not like them, which is which is really difficult. You went on to become someone who started writing about your experience. I remember I first read your op ed in the newspaper, and it was it was it was amazing how you spoke about what you believed in, how people changed you and why you now believe differently.  But when you go back and speak to the people who you preached hate to, they don't come with.  You know, when I left, I left alone. And I spent a lot of years totally alone. There were a couple of people who I could keep in contact with. But once I left that community, it wasn't even clear that I was going to be able to talk to my parents. And there's not an anti-racist world that you just moved to. So I spent a bunch of years even not knowing what I should do and not talking to anybody and going by my middle name and trying to believe that I never would have to speak about this again.  And then maybe in that way I could continue living a life.  So now not only are you not racist, your last name is black, which is an added it's like an added part of the story.  The the the part of the book that really, really gripped me was when I was writing about your relationship with your father and how he genuinely treats this like a death in the family where he sees you as the son he wishes he never had, because you now go against everything that he truly does believe. How do you grapple with that? I mean, we struggle with this so much as human beings. I'm assuming you still love him because he's your father, but you also speak out against the rampant hatred that he professes and taught you.  I think in a kind of weird way, the stuff that I was raised with, that although all of society thinks we're nuts, this is truth and we have to say it. And that we've gotten there by being independent thinkers who are curious and look at facts, even though everybody says it's wrong, like that stuff was also the things that I needed to be able to leave it. And I know he doesn't exactly see it that way, but I think in some ways he respects that.  I believe something strong enough that I'm happy to talk about it. That's the value that I was raised with, even if it didn't end up how he hoped. When you look at the conversation around white nationalism and Donald Trump, there is no mistaking the rise as your book talks about all of this rhetoric. The Stormfront website that I believe you designed, correct words that parts of it you designed, I think when you're like ten years old, which is which is insane, that website after Trump was elected, experienced its highest traffic.  Right. So we're starting to see that there is something in what Trump is saying that connects with this message that is completely white nationalist.  I think that's totally true. I think the even scarier thing is the things that Trump are saying that are pretty explicitly white nationalists also connect with a large portion of white voters in the country. I mean, we see studies all the time that 30 or 40 percent of whites believe they experience more prejudice. They're the victims of prejudice and discrimination more than people of color or Jews, which is actually wildly off base. But by playing to that sense of grievance, white nationalists and people in power like the president, by saying things like, we don't want people here from shithole countries or, you know, we need to build a wall by retweeting stats about black on white crime.  Right. Factually incorrect. It's effective. It gets people elected. And I think that's the scary power of this ideology. It's historically embedded in a lot of what the United States has been. And unless we go through the act of confronting it, it's going to continue to grow and be a dangerous force in what the country is. May I ask you this before we go? As someone who grew up white nationalist, as someone who studied, I guess, more than anybody would, would you say you consider Donald Trump a white nationalist?  He's not a white nationalist because a white nationalist is this little insular world where everybody believes a bunch of very specific things. But I was raised with a really firm belief that has always been true, that America was founded as a white supremacist country, that a lot of people's assumptions about race in America remain there and that's untapped. And what he taps into is the same thing that white nationalists tap into when they're trying to recruit, when they're trying to convince somebody to go from some sort of garden variety, sort of racist belief to something that's ramped up that's more extreme.  That process looks exactly the same.  So in a way, it's almost like there's a like a latent or dormant idea that is embedded in America. It's something if you just work against. Right. I think the big surprise recently has been that it's a lot harder to be an anti racist than it is to be a white nationalist, because being an anti-racist means you're saying we have to change the status quo. Being a white nationalist is saying that things are fine as they are and you're good and don't give them an inch if they call you a racist.  And that's easier to tell somebody. They don't have to do anything. It's a powerful story. And honestly, I was fascinated by it because you share your experiences in a really transparent way. And there's only one question I had, and it sounds like a joke and sort of is.  But are you not afraid that, like, you now know the non truth? So what if, like, would you flip the other way? Does that make sense because you believe something was true for so long and now you go like, no, the opposite is true. Do you ever wonder if it's the other way around? Like, how how do you know how do you contort your brain around that idea?  Because I've never flipped on an idea like that extreme, if that makes sense. So how do you say to yourself, no, now I believe the correct thing.  Yeah. Yeah, no, it's legitimate. It is hard. I think for those years where I was living in the wilderness. Right. Metaphorically, like, what do I do? I spent a lot of time saying, what are my assumptions about the world? What what do I think about things, what do I think about people and how much of that comes from something that I never even really challenged and figuring out how I make choices and what I speak about and what I do.  There's still a part of me that says maybe I can't even trust things I feel convictions for. But I do think that I can say that if I if I'm driven by what doesn't hurt people, like what makes life better for people, then attacking a white supremacist system that is unfair, that is unjust, and being the person in the room who challenges the latent white nationalism is something that does that and makes life better for people. Including white people, right?  And that is a value that I don't think is could be wrong and that that was what was missing before. It was the fact that I considered the only people who were important, who I needed to advocate for was this little group. And realizing that that's that's wrong, that the little group has to expand and that we are all a part of this. And if something hurts other people, then we have to figure out a way to change the system so that we are all included and that we can all work for there.  And you have to be the voice in the room doing that because it doesn't just happen. The status quo is not going to lead us there. The only thing that undermines a white nationalist is trying to ram somebody up to a more extreme version of racism as somebody in the room challenging those beliefs, keeping it from escalating and reminding them that what you're saying is wrong.  Do you think white people would be more effective at that? Would you like do you think there could be more white people who are actively doing that as opposed to, as you said, turning a blind eye and saying, like, I don't like that you believe that political hangout, it's a white person in the room who has the strongest voice to counteract a racist thought. We were aware of that as white nationalists. We were explicitly aware that if you were talking to somebody and you're trying to get them to go from those Mexicans or maybe the south side of Chicago is a problem and get them to escalate into it's about race.  We want the person who's going to ruin that for you is another white person who's saying stop that because it's equal like they have they have literal skin in the game.  And what they say shuts any any sort of white nationalist racist thing you're saying down and it stops the room. And that's the thing that people can do. That's the thing that people at college did. It's the thing that anyone, anywhere can do is speak up, because being silent is a choice. Wow.  Rising out of hatred is available now. It's a fascinating story, I really recommend it. Eli Saslow.

I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and if you're like me, you're probably worried right now, in part because of the fascist insurrection on January 6th in Washington, D.C. But what if I were to tell you that what happened in D.C. was just the latest in more than a century of fascist attempts to take over democratic governments, many of them successful, learn about the history of these insurrections and the history of anti fascist actions attempting to stop them."}]}

It's a very binary, you know, the Iraq war, it's glorious for the first year and a half and then suddenly it's not.  Yes. And we're shocked that. US invading another country might turn out to be messy. Hopefully that's not a lesson we have to repeatedly rely on.  It's been 30 years since the first episode of Beverly Hills, 1981, OK, 30 years since we walk the halls of West Beverly High and since we all hung out at the Peach Pit, relive it all with Jenny Garth and Tori Spelling on their new podcast, 1991. OMG, we get to tell the fans all of the behind the scenes stories actually happened to them as they watch every episode of the beloved 90s TV show. From the very beginning, listen to Nyarota and OMD on the I Heart radio app or wherever you get your podcasts.  Who was David Bowie? Well, that depends on who you ask or which record you play. To some, he's Ziggy Stardust. To others, the thin white do or Major Star. But who is David Bowie? Were you to answer that question will have to go off the record. My name is Jordan Rontgen. I'm the host of Off the Record, a new music biography podcast from my heart. Radio off the record goes beyond the songs and into the hearts and minds of rock's greatest legends.  Every season profiles one classic artist taking listeners on a wild ride through their extraordinary career.  The first season examines the life or rather lives of David Bowie. Every episode of the 11 part audio event tells the story of one of his iconic personas. Together, these faces form an intimate portrait of one of the 20th century's most influential figures. So who was David Bowie? Tune in to.  Off the record to find out. The series premieres on January 18th. Listen and follow on the I Heart Radio Apple podcast wherever you listen to your favorite shows. Twenty twenty was a year for many of racial reckoning. It was the year when people of all ages took to the streets, black and white alike, and said, we need to change the way the police deal with people in this country, predominantly black people in this country. It was an interesting time as well, because, I mean, your presidency, as you know better than anyone and people thought, well, that is it.  We're now in a post-racial utopia. Barack Obama is in the White House. We have half black, half whites, all black. Good times. Let's have a good one. And then people saw that there was still a lot of work to be done.  Let's talk a little bit about the movement as you see it. The problem I have with headline sometimes is like people take things out of context, et cetera. But some activists criticize you for saying they've got to be careful of snappy slogans like defund the police because it loses people. But I wonder, do you think that the slogan is off? Is is the thing that makes people for or against you? Or do you think people are just going to be for or against you?  And then the slogan doesn't really mean as much. And what I mean by that is like like Donald Trump's Make America great again. It's not a it's not a very divisive slogan. If you look at it on the face of it, that's a great slogan. Why would anyone not want to make America great again? But the subtext is something else. When you're thinking of that as someone who's great at slogans, by the way, I mean, yes, we can it snappy.  It works.  Although as I said in the book, I actually thought it was corny.  I didn't I didn't like very much when when my team came up with it. And then they went to ask Michele and Michele said, no, it's not corny, it's fine. So clearly, she had a better political brain than I did on this. I'm glad you actually brought this up, because you know, what's been fascinating while I've been on this book tour is, you know, people have asked me what's my source of optimism? And uniformly, what I have said is nothing made me more optimistic during a very difficult year than the activism that we saw in the wake of George Floyds Murder and Black Lives Matter.  And I have consistently believed that their courage. Activisms, media savvy, strategic resolve far exceeds anything that I could have done it at their age and I think has shifted the conversation in ways that I would not have even imagined a couple of years ago. So throughout this slew of compliments, I then said, well, what do you think about the particular slogan, defund the police? And I said, well, that particular slogan, I think the concern is that there may be potential allies out there that you lose.  And the issue always is.  How do you get enough people to support your cause that you can actually institutionalize it and translate it into laws, right structures and so forth? Or two or three writers who I admire who wrote Obama's making it a mission to chastise Black Lives Matter? And you know what? Hold on a second.  I just spent the whole summer complimenting them. What are you talking about?  The reason it caught attention, I suspect, is there were some in the Democratic Party who suggested the reason we didn't do better in the congressional elections this time was because of this phrase. And I think that people assumed that somehow I was making an argument that that's why we didn't get, you know, a bigger Democratic majority.  That actually was not the point I was making. I was making a very particular point around. If we, in fact, want to translate the the.  The very legitimate belief that how we do policing needs to change and that if there is, for example, a homeless guy ranting and railing in the middle of the street. Sending a. A mental health worker. Rather than an armed, untrained police officer, to deal with that person might be a better outcome for all of us and make us safer. Right, that if we describe that to. Not just white folks, but let's say Michelle's mom. That makes sense to them.  But if we say defund the police, not just white folks, but Michelle's mom might say, if I'm getting robbed, who am I going to call and is somebody going to show up? Right. So the issue here becomes, you know, at any given time, how are we translating and using language not to make people more comfortable, quote unquote? Right. Because that's always a strain. And historically, the concern in these debates is also as often or are we just trying to make white people comfortable rather than speaking truth to power?  Right. That's the framework. We tend to think about these things, right? Yeah. The issue to me is not making them comfortable. It is. Can we be precise with our language enough that people who might be. Persuaded around that particular issue to make a particular change that gets a particular result that we want, what's the best way for us to describe that?  And you're basically saying is we should workshop all of our slogans with Michelle? That's what I say. That probably would be wise. It would probably work. But but I want to go back to something you said earlier, which I think is really important. And I and I said this in the wake of some of this criticism, I said, look, part of this is also everybody has different roles to play. An activist, a movement leader is is going to provide a prophetic voice and speak certain truths that somebody who is going to be elected into office will not be able to say.  I reread James Baldwin's a fire next time this summer. How is it that something written 50 years ago? Fifty five years ago. Yeah, yeah.  Applies directly to today. Right. Despite everything that's happened. To me, that is as serious and as honest a a portrayal of the the the gaping wound of race in America.  But of course, James Baldwin can be elected to the US Senate or unlikely that he would want to be the mayor of a city who's responsible for figuring out how do I deal with the police union. Right. That's somebody else's role. And and all these roles are important.  And so, you know, why do you think if I may interrupt, why do you think, though, that Republicans or right wingers now do that? That's that's something that I've struggled to to to understand. You see, now, even in this election, I mean, some of the Republicans who are running were Kuhnen supporters and they were going, we're running. And this is what and some of them were winning. Some of them are so extreme and they're winning.  And so I sometimes wonder if if there's this this isn't just a political thing in America where if you if you're in the Republican Party, you can be completely bombastic in what you believe in.  And then as a Democrat, you're trying to tow the line between centrist and and and left leaning.  Well, because I think, in fact, the Republican Party is the minority party in this country. The only reason that it doesn't look like they're the minority party is because of structures like the US Senate and the Electoral College that don't render them the majority party. So so they have certain built-In advantages around power, given their population distribution and how our government works. But the truth of the matter is, is that 60 percent of the people are occupying what I would consider a more reality based universe.  And those are the those are the constituents we're speaking to. And that is a more diverse group. You know, I describe in the book the first time I go to the to the Republican House caucus to speak to them. And I think there was an Asian guy or gal and maybe a couple of Hispanics, and that was it. It is much more homogeneous, which means that, yes, they have to do less work, but it also.  Means that they are they can talk to themselves. And as a consequence of the way our democracy, our republic is structured, they don't have to appeal to as broad of a base. That's not fair. But, you know, I at least would prefer not having the progressives model ourselves out of our model ourselves on the current Republican Party, that doesn't feel like a good strategy to me to get the outcomes that we want.  Let's talk a little bit about let's loosen things up. Let's unbutton one of those one one of those buttons on the shirt.  As someone who I consider to be one of the best deliverers of jokes and and roasts, are you going to be more careful going forward about who you are? And I say this because you roasted Donald Trump, who ran for president. You roasted Kanye West. He ran for president. So I don't know if you've noticed, but you have an ability to inspire people to run for the highest office in the land with some of the jokes that you tell about them.  Well, I should I should roast people, people I admire more. I'll start roasting you. Who knows? Although you were born here. So.  Yeah, but look, I was in the department.  Who knows?  Before I let you go, I wanted to know one last thing, and that is being president of the United States is arguably the toughest job in the world when you transition back to professional life. I wonder what that is like, because unlike you, I don't have that power, I've never been able to, like, just change a thing in the world or do something about it. But now, in many ways, you are like me in that you see the thing on the TV and then you get angry or sad, but you cannot really do anything about it.  And so I wonder to as as former President Barack Obama, have you have you transitioned into that completely or do you find different ways to try and fix the problems that you see in the world?  Well, first of all, I'm not anything like you. I still have a lot of clout. So let's just be clear. Come on, man. Look, I want you to have it in perspective.  I was hoping you I was hoping you just let that one slide. I was hoping you'd just be like, yeah, you know, in many ways.  Look, the truth is that. I I did not have those kinds of withdrawals, and I know that there are people who I know who've had them when they leave public life and very visibly, you know, they want to get back on stage. Yeah, Michelle and I, that's something we share. We feel good about the work we did. We don't feel anxiety about not being the center of attention. We get frustrated like I think citizens around the world and here in the country do when we see something unjust or unfair.  And yes, the goal, I think, for us is to find new ways to have that same impact, understanding that we'll never have the exact same impact as you have office.  But, you know, a lot of the work around the foundation is, you know, you said create a lot of Obama's. I'm not sure that's the goal. But to, you know, if 10 years, 20 years down the road, there are a thousand ten thousand one hundred thousand young people who are now moving into positions of authority and power and in some ways have been shaped by our example in a positive way. Yeah, that that's the legacy that may exceed anything that we did while we were in in our formal positions.  And and that feels pretty good. Well, I can talk to you for hours, but luckily I have a 700 page book to answer the rest of my questions. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for taking the time. And yeah. Thank you for being you, Mr.. Mr. President or Bizzle. Thank you for joining me on The Daily Show.  We'll do it again after.

And we don't realize that these processed foods are high in sugar and salt in ways that that's the kind of thing that affects you.  It's it's the content of the food. People think, well, a French fry is a potato and it's like, well, you know, if that's all you're eating and it's fried and it's processed, you're getting extra stuff in there.  So, you know, the key, like you said, is not to shame people, not to blame folks. And that's where it gets personal because people do feel judged and criticized for doing the best that they can. So that's why we start with kids. It's like, let's make these conversations fun again.  Not not a lot of stick, but a whole lot of carrot, which is what we try to do with let's move. Let's not talk about not eliminating soda and soda is bad.  Let's talk about drinking more water. Right. Because if you drink more water by that very nature, you will drink less soda. That doesn't make soda bad. We're just talking about drink a little more water. So, you know, we've had to learn how to balance that because even in the White House, we got criticized for having those conversations.  I mean, getting kids to eat healthy was a controversial. And people were like, how dare she? It's nanny state.  And I'm like, I. I thought we were like some like even, you know, sort of like what? What.  So, you know, you had to sort of be really strategic and how you talked about this so that people wouldn't feel like you were judging the very core of who they are. And that's the thing.  Food is personal, you know, and waffles. And most Mokey address the notion that, you know, cultures are built on the food that they eat. You know, it's love, it's family. However you do it. It is. It's at the core of who we are. So you've got to be careful not to judge the way people do it. Just offer them different approaches, you know, open their minds and starting with kids who will bring their own curiosity.  I saw this dish cooked on the show. Can we try it? And you notice the cooking is done a lot on hot plates, in toaster ovens. You know, a lot of vegetables. It's accessible and that's for a reason. And the recipes are on the website along with the past the love campaign waffles and McKeag. So we're encouraging people to interact with the show through the website. And kids can earn their badges like Waffles and Motoki. So, you know, again, our our goal is to make it fun.  Well, I think you're well on the way to achieving that goal, and I really hope that personal love goes from a million to 10 million to one hundred million until there's no need to pass any more love. Michelle Obama, thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you for joining us. Say hi to the husband and good luck on the rest of your journey.  So good to see you. Congratulations on all your good stuff. Very proud of you.  Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Don't forget, Waffles and Mokey is available now on Netflix.

On today's episode of the show, we catch up on all things inauguration, how Biden came in, how Trump went out, and how Melania stopped pretending that she's happy.  Plus, our guest tonight is the woman many credit for, Dikembe Mutombo, Mitch McConnell, Stacey Abrams. She's going to be joining us on the show. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the daily social justice show with driven over years of. Today, the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and McDonald's share price in Florida just went way up because America just got a brand new dad.  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., do solemnly swear. Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute and I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, office of President of the United States. And will, to the best of my ability, well, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States Constitution of the United States.  So help you God. So help me God. Congratulations, Mr. President. I don't know about you, but this moment will stay in my memory forever. Joe Biden's middle name is Robinett. What but that's right. As of noon Eastern Time today, America welcomed the fresh young face of Joseph R. Biden as its forty sixth president. And despite the pandemic, this inauguration had it all former presidents, the youngest inaugural poet, an amazing singer wearing her own Etsy store, an old man on his way to the post office, and even a lady whose outfit just called me a broken bitch.  Biden was so committed to unity that he even invited enemies of the state. No, I'm joking. I'm joking, guys. I'm joking. Ted Cruz didn't try and overthrow the government. He just supported the people who did. Even Mike Pence attended the inauguration to honor the democratic transition of power. Kudos to Mike Pence. You can see him there with his mosque featuring the vice presidential seal. And as tradition dictates, once Comilla was sworn in, he gave that very same mosque for her to put on.  But before the new president could walk in, the old one had to be kicked out.  There you see Marine One on the lawn of the White House. President Trump still there, but as expected, depart any minute for Andrews Air Force Base and give a final speech before heading tomorrow.  I can tell you that from the bottom of my heart, this has been an incredible four years. We rebuilt the United States military. We created a new force called Space Force, and now the stock market is actually substantially higher than it was at its highest point prior to the pandemic. So it's really you could say we built it twice. I hope they don't raise your taxes. But if they do, I told you so. So just a goodbye.  We love you. We will be back in some form. Have a good life. We will see you soon.  Have a good life. That's not what a departing president is supposed to say. That's what you tell your best friend in high school when she starts dating your ex. I hope you two are very happy together. Have a good life, obviously, before prom. I don't you know, although I do like how he said he'll be back in some form because my man knows you got to leave on a cliffhanger. I'll be back in some form. Maybe I'll come back as a politician, maybe as a mutant fish monster, or maybe I'll come back as one of those old guys with a ponytail.  Stay tuned for Trump's last day in office. Wasn't all just whining and stealing silverware. No, my friends, he also made sure to hand out some very nice parting gifts to all his friends.  President Trump announces more than one hundred and forty pardons and commutations.  The list ranges from the president's political allies to nonviolent drug offenders. Steve Bannon pleaded not guilty to defrauding donors in a fundraising campaign for President Trump's border wall. But before the trial could even get underway, the president gave him a preemptive pardon. Three former Republican congressmen and commuted the sentence of Detroit's former Democratic mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving time on corruption charges. The president also pardoned rappers Lil Wayne and Chodak Black on their separate federal weapons related offenses.  That's right, people. Donald Trump pardoned a ton of shady people in the last hours of his presidency, which means those fraudsters can get back to defrauding and Steve Bannon can get back to selling music. The weird part, though, was how he kept trying to give prison time to Eric. I'm sorry, Eric. The rule in prison is one in, one out. It's just like the nightclubs.  I'm going to miss you, Eric. Jokes have a good life now. What was really crazy is that Trump pardoned Chodak Black and Lil Wayne, which sounds like a good thing. I mean, it's cool to pardon anyone, I guess, but it's a terrible thing to do to a rapper because you're taking away their street cred. Now, what are they going to rap about?  Yeah, young wizzy babe, I can get enough of that again to get them to legally buy a gun in all states. Now you see me on the street on my way to jury duty where their booty. That is good.  Honestly, if you ask me, I think it's incredible that Trump didn't pardon himself because it means that even President Trump looked at Donald Trump's record and decided, man, I can't let this go off that easy. Then again, some people actually speculating that Trump secretly wrote himself a pardon that he can use later. And honestly, I hope that he did. Because he's Donald Trump, so, you know, he's just going to end up wasting that party on some bullshit.  Mr. Trump, your car is illegally parked in a handicapped spot. You're getting a ticket. Well, now's the perfect time to use my one and only burden.  I'll see you when I come back from a game of golf. Now, Trump is not the first president to issue shady pardons on his way out the door. I mean, Bill Clinton famously pardoned his brother and a really dodgy businessman whose ex-wife donated to Clinton's library. And yes, don't get me wrong. Trump took it to a whole new level, but he's not unique.  If anything, I think he should have gone further. I'm not going to lie. I'm really pissed off that all the people Trump chose to pardon, he didn't pardon Joe Exotic because I don't know about you, but I know I need a second season of that show. I need more Tiger King. Not the only thing I can watch on Netflix is that Bridget Jones show every day. Bridget, Bridget. I'm falling in love with that Duke. I'm sitting there wondering what all babies would look like if we were a couple, probably like us.  And it wasn't just last minute pardons last night at literally one o'clock in the morning. Donald Trump also did this.  Breaking overnight, President Donald Trump signing an executive order releasing current and former members of his administration from the terms of their ethics pledge. That pledge, one of Trump's first executive orders back in twenty seventeen when he pledged to drain the swamp. It required Trump's political appointees to agree to the lobbying ban, as well as pledge not to undertake work that would require them to register as a foreign agent after leaving government.  So after all that time talking about how he's going to drain the swamp, the one rule he actually made to reduce corruption he got rid of right before he left office. But let's be real, though. People electing Trump to reduce corruption is like hiring Hilaria Baldwin to handle your PR crisis. The results are going to be no bueno. But on the other hand, I do get why he's doing this. Trump stuff is have to become lobbyists. I mean, where else are they going to go with their resumes?  So why do you think you'd be a good employee for a pet? Well, you guys keep pets in cages and we used to keep kids in cages.  OK, we'll be in touch.  And so with Trump finally gone, it was time for President Biden to get the key from under the mat and settle into the house that they'd spent all day getting ready for him.  Right now, the White House residence staff are going around the White House and boxing up anything that the Trump family may have left behind. Trump officials insist that the place is going to be sanitized with particular care and covid-19 in mind. Part of what is going to be moved in and different in the White House residence is that the Bidens will I here share a bedroom? The Trumps, of course, at separate bedrooms. So this will be switched. All the mattresses will be refreshed.  We're so used to seeing the new president walk up the steps under the North Portico into the White House to be greeted by the outgoing president of the United States. And there you saw Joe Biden and the first lady not greeted by anybody outside the front door of the White House. In fact, the previous president had skipped town before the inauguration. So Biden left there to sort of be a self greeter in many ways and let himself into the White House, into the front door.  Yeah. Trump wasn't there to greet Biden at the White House, which is a snub. But on the other hand, I'm not sure that Trump needs to be there now because how would that conversation even go? You know what actually used to work here? So you don't need to show me where The Situation Room is, the Situation Room now. I know it's Inauguration Day and everyone wants to throw a party, but remember, it's also Wednesday, which means it's still a workday.  And so after he got back to the White House, President Joseph Robinette Biden went straight to work. And let's just say the White House bathrooms aren't the only place Biden is looking to wipe out any trace of Donald Trump.  Just hours after being sworn in, President Joe Biden is already putting the pen to a number of executive orders. This is common practice. As presidents enter office.  Biden expected to sign roughly a dozen executive orders undoing some of Donald Trump's most controversial move. He will immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord, reportedly cancelled the Keystone pipeline and will reverse the so-called Muslim travel ban and take the first step in his fight against covid mandating masks on federal lands and extending the powers of student loan payments.  Wow. That is a huge reversal of Trump's legacy, rejoining the Paris Accords, canceling the Keystone pipeline and even repealing the infamous Muslim ban. Although with America's covid rates right now, I don't actually think that last one is going to make much of a difference. Come on over. Muslim countries. Come on to America. Actually, we have Zoome now. So you guys kind of keep your coffee. Now, this is really good news and I'm glad that America is rejoining the Paris accord.  But you've got to admit this back and forth. This must be so weird for other countries because under Obama. America celebrated the Paris Accords, but then under Trump, it was like the Paris Accords, let the planet and the to Biden it's like, all right, guys, I'm I'm back in the Paris accord. Sorry. And I'm also back on my meds. Sorry about that. So, my friends.  Donald, Jesus Christ, that was crazy. Trump has officially departed the White House for the last time.  And I know I know that many people are angry right now at the state that he left this country in. But I implore you to try and look at the few silver linings. One, America survived Trump and in doing so displayed its resilience and to Trump's term, has truly exposed so many of the flaws in America's system. And I know for some day one of Joe Biden's presidency may be too soon to think about fixing America's problems. But you need to start fixing them now because before, you know, it's twenty, twenty four will be here and Donald Trump might be back in some form.  All right. When we come back, we'll see how today stacked up to other inaugurations. Spoiler alert, it had a lot less dead birds. And Stacey Abrams is still joining us on the show.  So stick around.

Welcome back to the daily social distancing show, Joe Biden's inauguration did not look like a typical one, partly because of the pandemic, partly because the National Guard was protecting him from the previous presidents.  But what does a typical Inauguration Day look like? Well, actually, there really isn't one to find out why, it's time for another episode of If You Don't Know Now you know.  The first thing to understand about Inauguration Day is that there's no reason it has to be a full day. There's only one thing that really has to happen, and it takes about two minutes as long as nothing goes wrong.  There are speeches. Parades and ball is gone, but according to the U.S. Constitution, the only requirement is for the president to take the oath for an entire government hands over a baton to the next government.  It does not happen until the words of the oath are uttered and the words matter. You have to say the words correctly. Barack Obama had to take the oath of office twice in 2009.  That's because Chief Justice John Roberts misspoke and one word was out of sequence that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully, that I will execute. The off faithfully the president office of president of the United States, people immediately people called it a botched oath. Some people even question, is President Obama a real president? Oh, man."}]}

It's my first time being on your show. It's just, you know, I'm sad that it's not in face to face or in person, but I'm glad I am.  I'm sad. I'm sad, too. But I don't like you still here. I have gotten used to this being here for me. So, you know, it's still you know, I'm going to tell me, like your personality changes when you're in person.  It does not. I'm maybe I'm more silly in person, but I've gotten silly on, you know, in June, too. I can do it both now. Just plain silly.  Before we get into talking about your projects, let's talk a little a little bit about that. I would love to know on a personal level what your life has felt like since you left the White House, because I remember and I mean, I was one of the fans, maybe because I also had had journeys. I remember everyone just being like, wow, Michelle, the afro in the has come and everyone is just like she's just she's got a different swag about her.  Wasn't there a weight that's lifted from your shoulders when leaving the White House as first lady? Absolutely.  I mean, for for so many reasons. I mean, you know, being the first lady and the press, it's a it's a huge responsibility. And being the first, you know, we felt a deep responsibility to do it right and to do it better, to be careful with our words, all the things we thought were important things like.  Thinking about what you say before you say it, you know, telling the truth, you know, getting your facts right, all of this, we were worried for no reason we could have done it so differently.  It could have been easier. But no, no, we were doing the traditional thing. And so, you know, it was a big responsibility, a big weight on our shoulders, but it was an honor to serve. And we kept our eye focused on just every day trying to show up. Right. And push the ball forward on the issues that we cared about.  But we were also doing it while raising our kids. All right. So right. You know, they were 10 and seven when we entered. They lived in the White House longer than they lived in any house they've ever lived in.  So they they were growing up right in that spotlight. And so we had that pressure of getting through the adolescent years, in the teen years and sending it to college.  So we were exhausted and stressed because not only are you trying to get it right on the big picture level, but you're trying to get it right as a parent. And now we're on the other end of that on literally on the other end of all of that.  And our kids are about to be twenty three and twenty. Our oldest is graduating from college. They are alive.  So all of that, you know, being at the end of that part of the journey, you know, it you know, I am in a different place.  I feel freer. I feel more at peace. I'm also older. So I'm more comfortable. I'm even more comfortable in my own skin.  I can imagine so. So, yeah, yeah.  It was, you know, I mean, living in the White House is like living in an nice older hotel where you can't get out unless you call 20 people.  It almost feels like you were living a sort of quarantined life before.  All of this is what I tell people. This is why we're fine. Barack and I are like, what? You can't go out just when you want to. Yeah, you're like this. We've been doing that for eight years. You've got security with you at all times. You can't make a move. And you have to think about how your movements impact the rest of the world. Every time we went out, we had to think about it.  It's like who's going to have to shut down what gate? How is this going to disrupt this whole community? Because the presidential motorcade is coming through, we have to worry about agents and not doing something that will put them in harm's way.  We're good in quarantine. We're like, welcome to our world.  Everyone has been somebody who has been not just an icon, but but somebody that people have followed so passionately from the beginning. And and what I loved about reading your book and and talking to your husband is that, you know, is getting into the familial side of things, the personal side of things. I've always wanted to know from your perspective, because a lot of people may not think of it like this because of president, but you're the cool one in the relationship.  Right.  And so like but Barack was like this, like, you know, it's like like you say in your book, who's this? Who's this like, you know what I mean. And yes, he's Mr. President, don't get me wrong. But I mean, to us, Barack, is there a part of you that like when it was done, you were like, all right, finally the power balance can go back to what it was?  Well, he's still pretty cool, you know. Oh, definitely.  But I mean, you know, I mean, it's like a game of chess. You want to lose the queen, you know that.  I'm going to use that at dinner tonight. Right.  But what's fun to see is how it feels like you are each other's biggest fans, the way you show your love towards each other. You've never been afraid to do that. But at the same time, there's also a healthy, competitive spirit. I mean, whether you're selling books, whether you're releasing your your work on Netflix and creating documentaries, is there a little bit of that when you look at your numbers and then you go, I mean, you know, you go like Barry, you doing well, but, you know you know, is there a little bit of that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Barack is super competitive, so, you know, and shoot, let me I am too. So, yeah, there's a little there's a little bit of that. I mean but you know, you can do that when you know your partner holds their own. It's it's a nice, funny joke, you know. I mean if he if he wrote his book and nobody bought it, we wouldn't be joking about it. Right. We would be like, honey, you're doing a great job.  Oh, he has a great book. Great book. We love it.  And tell your dad how much you like his book. You know, I mean, he's written like a thousand book.  You know, he's like, yeah, I've done this before.  You're the new you know, he was he fed us on his book books for a very long time. So, you know, it's a funny joke when it's, you know. Well, is not true when it's when it's not fully true, the kids are actually joking, they're talking about how, you know, Mom's doing a lot of work out there. Dad, you're at home looking kind of cute.  You know, they're like you're now the one that is hilarious. You are the cute one.  Mr. President.

Let's talk a little bit about your new project on Netflix, it is it's a passion of yours that we've known from the very beginning, and that is eating healthy. You know, America has internationally established a reputation as being the country where people have some of the most unhealthy choices in how they eat.  I remember when I came to America, I didn't understand it genuinely came to America. I ate the way I ate in South Africa, did not really care. And then I got here and I remember the first time I was traveling around the US and nobody knew me. I was doing my thing was around twenty ten and I gained I think it was 18 to 20 pounds in six months and I didn't realize this was happening to me. And then I went back to South Africa and in Africa because there's no like body shaming in that way.  Everyone was just like, wow, did you eat half of America? What happened to you? Wow. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  You know, and it was it was actually interesting because I didn't think I changed anything. I didn't. But then I came to realize how hard it is for so many Americans to eat healthy, to exist, healthy, to be healthy. And that's always been your passion, which is part of the show that you have on Netflix Waffles and watching the most adorable exploration of eating healthy. Please just talk me through why you thought, you know what? This is the avenue that I'm going to take to further this message for what I'm passionate about.  The co creators, Erica Thorn, Ellen and Jeremy Connor, you came up with this idea because, you know, Jeremy had young kids and struggled with this as a parent, getting their kids excited about vegetables. So they came up with the idea and presented it to us and kind of proposed, would you be in it? And I looked at the concept and thought this this is a no brainer. I mean, this is what we had been talking about for eight years through Let's Move is that you can have these conversations not making them punitive or not shaming people, but just beginning to introduce positive concepts about what food is, making it fun, making it enjoyable.  Now, the part that I'm excited about is the work that we're doing through the past the love campaign, where we're hoping to do more education around food insecurity and rising food deserts and reminding people that there are millions of people in this country that are going hungry even as they sit in communities with food all around them.  Right.  But it's it's it's the type of food so many families don't have access to fresh produce. If they want to buy a bundle of kale, they've got to get on a bus or it costs way too much money they don't have the ability to do at home cooking.  The Pasta Love campaign is designed to raise money to help feed a million families in this country.  What I love about waffles and mulches, I mean, we all grew up watching puppets and cartoons, and it's really fun to see these discussions. Like my favorite episode is just the arguments about whether a tomato is a fruit or vegetable. I've had this fight with people my entire life, tomatoes, avocados, whatever it is, I go, Hey man, I have a simple metric. Is it sweet? Then it's a fruit and then people want to fight with me.  And I think it's fun. It's fun to engage with that. I can imagine enjoying that with kids and having these conversations because I grew up I grew up loving vegetables and the reason I grew up loving vegetables is because we didn't always have a lot of food. And I realized very, very young that if I could learn to love the things that nobody else wanted, then I would always have have for all the other kids they were running for, like the meat and the fish.  And I was like, I'll take the broccoli, the cauliflower. And I just learned to love it. But it's cool to see from that side for the kids.  Yeah, I knew you were on the other side with pasta love.  What I've really enjoyed is you you having the conversation about the truth, about how difficult it is. You know, a lot of the time in America, people blame the victim. Yes. They go, you should be eating healthy. You should be making better choices. You should.  And then I remember when I when I first got to America, I was like, wow, how much is an avocado that's raised like this or how much is this? Because in South Africa, the treat is the McDonald's. Your family can't just buy you that every day. Right? In America, it's like, no, the fast food is affordable and that's no.  Yeah, that's how it was for us growing up. So this is also generational. I mean, the whole notion of going out wasn't something that you did. People couldn't afford it and it wasn't available like that. So going to a fast food place was a treat. But for the most part, being able to afford to live meant you had to cook. That was the cheapest way to. Yes, you bought a whole chicken. You knew how to cut it up.  You knew how to dice up some some some vegetables. You you knew how to cook a pot of greens. I mean, that's how we all grew up. And it's with this change in sort of mass-producing. The quick, easy and understandably, parents struggle with that because everybody's busy now and we're overworked, so it's easy to pick up, grab something, pop something to do something processed. And we don't realize that these processed foods are high in sugar and salt in ways that that's the kind of thing that affects you.  It's it's the content of the food.  People think, well, a French fry is a potato and it's like, well, you know, if that's all you're eating and it's fried and it's processed, you're getting extra stuff in there.  So, you know, the key, like you said, is not to shame people, not to blame folks. And that's where it gets personal because people do feel judged and criticized for doing the best that they can."}]}

The NBA is taking on coronavirus and everyone has already forgotten about what's his name, the guy with the hair. Plus, Jelani Cobb is on the show to talk about what's next for the country. So let's do this, people. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.  From Trevor's coach in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world, this is The Daily Show with criminal lawyers.  Let's kick things off with a story that just won't end the coronavirus pandemic, because I know America has begun a new era, but Corona doesn't care about who's president. In fact, it's been exactly one year since we first learned that covid-19 had reached the United States and things have only gotten worse. Yesterday, the country set a new record for coronavirus deaths, and the CDC now predicts that half a million deaths will happen by mid-February, which is going to make for a weird Valentine's Day.  And Valentine's Day is already pretty weird, I suppose, by an adult woman, a teddy bear as creepy as hell. The point is, it's more important than ever to step up on covid safety, which is exactly what the NBA's doing.  Well, after witnessing some opposing players disregarding new league rules against unnecessary contact on game nights. The NBA is now moving team security to midcourt following games to stop the hugging and handshakes that may cause an unwanted spread of covid-19. High fives, hugs and handshakes, along with extended postgame conversations are no longer allowed.  Man, this is so hosch guys. covid won't even let you shake hands with opponents. Now, that's a hard habit to break because we've been doing that since we were five years old. You know, you play a game when you line up and you high five, the other team saying good game. Next, they're going to say that what, covid won't let you eat three slices at half time or drive past the ice cream store because your dad says only one does deserve ice cream.  But look, I get it. You've got to do what you've got to do to stop covid, and who knows, this could even create some excitement after the game.  And here it is, Harden going up for a high five. And this is it. Oh, no. He's rejected. He's rejected by a security guard named Stanley at the same time, though.  Well, let's really make a difference. I mean, I'm all for covid safety, but these guys have been sweating and breathing on each other for two hours already and then they can't shake hands. It's like handing out condoms as people are leaving your orgy. Remember to be safe. Remember, that was fun, guys. Remember, Dave, remember, there was no I mean, I'm not going to like this just shows how covid has turned the whole world upside down.  Players are now getting into trouble for being nice to each other, like, yeah, you better hold me back.  I'm about to hug. Just yeah. I respect you. So I will hug you right now. Whoo hoo hoo. Anyway, between the pandemic and all the insanity around the presidential election, they have been all sorts of stories that we just haven't had time to talk about. But they've kind of gotten stuck in my brain. And I thought, well, maybe I could unstick them by sharing them with you.  For instance, here's some big news you might have missed out of Russia, a.k.a. Mean Canada, Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic, Alexei Navalny, who was nearly poisoned to death, returning to Russia and immediately detained a dangerous gamble for one of Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics.  And he was arrested minutes after arriving in Moscow, kissing his wife goodbye. Alexei Navalny has now been detained for at least 30 days, prompting outrage around the world. Navalny nearly died last year after being poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon novikoff. He fell ill on an airplane, blaming the Kremlin for the attack, something they deny. OK, I don't know what's crazy out here, that this dude went back to the same country that tried to kill him or that they arrested him when he got there.  Apparently in Russia, it's a felony to not die when they poison you. Why did you do that? You make to look like you don't know poison. Well, you do that. The Putin look, even Navalny is the bravest dude alive or he's just really grown to love the taste of poison. I mean, I don't know, maybe poison is delicious. It's just that no one ever survives to tell us maybe the most delicious thing in the world.  We don't know. Actually, I want to try poison, though. But either way, this guy has bigger balls than me. I'm not going to lie because I would not be going back to Russia right now. If we get the poisoning, it's the middle of winter or Putin has to do delay, right, for five minutes and you're done.  Meanwhile, in tech news, here's a story I really can't stop thinking about involving Bitcoin, the money that lives in space over the last few months, the value of the virtual currency has skyrocketed to insane heights, which is great for people who own it. But it'll never catch up to the market value of my Pok\u00e9mon cards. That's right, people. I've been saving up these bad mom.  What do you do about Pokemon anyway?  One of the big draws of Bitcoin is how secure it is.  Unfortunately for one investor, it's turning out to be a little too secure a virtual nightmare for a man with a quarter billion dollars in Bitcoin.  Yes, billion. He's forgotten his password. Stefan Thomas says he's been locked out of his account since twenty twelve. Back then, it wasn't as much of a forger because each of his seven thousand coins was worth about ten bucks in cash. Now, going the going rate, you know how much it is. It's thirty seven grand. What? The man has the password stored on an old hard drive, but he lost the password to that too. And there's only two more tries before he gets locked out.  Wow, what a feel good story in that I feel good that it's not me. This guy can't access a quarter billion dollars because he can't remember his password. Let me tell you something. For a quarter of a billion dollars, I'm hiring people to beat the shit out of me until I do remember. Don't go. Yeah, come on, guys. I know from talking to five case. Yes, yes, I remember. And finally from Colombia, an exciting setup for a brand new season of Narcos.  A notorious drug lords exotic pets are now posing an environmental disaster. Pablo Escobar is four hippos escaped after he was killed and are now taking over the marshlands in Colombia. Experts say they are breeding so fast there, there could be more than fifteen hundred in the next couple of years posing a danger to the people and wildlife.  They are now saying the so-called cocaine hippos should be shot because, yeah, you go shoot the cocaine hippos who were raised by Pablo Escobar. I'm just going to stay out of the water. And I know some people are going to be like, do you have to shoot those hippos? Why not just round them up and put them in a zoo?  No. We're not going to be taking Pablo Escobar as hippos and putting them in a zoo because, you know, three weeks later they're going to escape through a tunnel that they built out from under the cage. Is going to be a note left behind from the hippo saying no zookeeper alive can hold me.  Yeah, you see, some people would think that the Colombian hippos are going to sound Colombian, but hippos from Africa. So I like to keep the jokes authentic. I've got to say, though, man over reproduction is the most badass reason to be exterminated. When was the last time you had so much sex that the government had to step in? The good news is there is an easier solution to this problem. Just release some meth. GAYDOS to deal with the cocaine hippo's then to deal with the meth gaiters.  You release the Molly Cobras, then to take out the Molly Cobras, you release the straight edge Tagore's. They don't do cocaine because the real thrill is being in control. Here's a question I have, though. I've always wondered this. What's the deal with drug dealers and animals? It's like the higher you go up the ladder, the crazier your pet has to be. The dealer on the corner has a fish tank. The drug lord has hippo's.  I bet that family that invented Oxy has a T rex just chained up in the backyard. Why you can't you can have gotten more than just the fine, but let's move on now to the big story of the day, the inauguration of Joseph Robin Hood.  Biden yesterday after being sworn in on the book that knows when we're all going to die. Biden became the 40 sixth president of the United States, but he couldn't run the whole country himself. So immediately after being sworn in, he turned around and administered the oath of office to his new White House staff. And hopefully all four thousand people on the room were paying attention for new members of the Biden administration.  A virtual swearing in. And we have to restore the soul of this country. And I'm counting on all of you to be part of that.  And a stern warning for the new commander in chief. If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot. On the spot. No ifs, ands or buts.  OK, wow. That took a turn. Welcome to a new era of kindness and respect. And if you're not on board with that, I'll rip your nipples off. But insisting on respect is just one of the ways that President Biden is trying to make a clean break from his predecessor. In fact, he even redecorated his office to be as un trumpy as possible.  We're getting new details right now about the inside of President Biden's Oval Office. A bust of Cesar Chavez, for example, sitting behind the resolute desk along with statues of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.  It is Joe Biden's stamp on the Oval Office, but some of it is familiar. If you see those gold drapes, you see the blue carpet on the floor. Those are in the Oval Office during the Bill Clinton presidency because the decor is certainly different than it was under President Trump.  OK. First question, is it really an improvement to switch out Trump's carpet for Bill Clinton's I mean, on Trump's carpet? Yes, you can catch covid, but on Clintons, you could get pregnant. And look, I respect history, but at some point it starts getting suspicious. This desk was used by President Roosevelt. Whoa. And these chairs were set on by President Kennedy and these drapes were hung by President Monroe.  Are you broke? Is that what's going on here? But I do think it's cool that no matter what other changes the president makes, the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. stays behind because no one wants to be the guy who removes the bust of MLK once it enters the room. It's never good. If a tornado hit the Oval Office, it would still go around MLK.  I'm not racist. I'm not racist. Now, of course, redecorating the Oval Office is just a symbolic change, but even after one day, people are already noticing how different Biden's presidency will be from Donald Trump's.  You just got President Biden's schedule for tomorrow, his first full day in office as as president. I imagine it's a little bit busier than what we've been reading.  This the former president's schedule, and this is a return to normalcy, also return to functioning government. The White House press office is now actually sending out press releases that are informative. So instead of having the Trump administration say Trump is making many calls, the Biden team is actually revealing the calls. That's a good sign. That's progress.  President Biden is now unveiling a national strategy to tackle covid.  First of all, I just have to say that it's great that we have somebody that comes out and actually has a plan today, felt like a new day.  I mean, the press briefing was boring as hell, and that was refreshing how we didn't have to count how many lives Jen Psaki was telling. We didn't have to get up there and hear her talking about the largest crowd size of yelling at the media.  Yo, guys, Joe Biden is so lucky. All he has to do is have a vaccine plan and not live for ten minutes. And he's basically, what, the next George Washington. And we all know this is only thanks to Donald Trump for setting the bar so low.  It's like getting hired as a babysitter. And your predecessor was a Roomba covered in knives. You got to be better and less useful. Life lesson here for all of us. Always follow the worst possible person. Like if you want to date someone, wait until after they've broken up with Armie Hammer. Baby, I promise I will never eat your flesh. What a gentleman. In fact, people are so excited to be moving on from Trump that some at Biden's inauguration celebration were already pretending that Trump never existed at all.  The appearances by three former presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, but not President Trump.  Well, I think the fact that the three of us are standing here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country. We've got to not just listen to folks we agree with, but listen to folks we don't. You think about the three presidents, the three former presidents that we saw gathered together to speak about this moment in history, to speak about the new president.  The former president who just left office could have been among those three, could have been four and forever more. Now one considers when there are gatherings of all the presidents, will the most recent president who just left? Will he be in there? All right.  Is it just me or was Anderson Cooper working overtime to avoid saying the word Trump? Dude, you can't summon him by saying his name, but as an ex-president, not Beetlejuice. Just say Trump. But I will say this. I'm not surprised. And nobody should be surprised that Trump doesn't want to be a part of the former president's club. It's kind of like when Don Felder left the Eagles because he was jealous of Glenn Frey and Don Henley success.  OK, I'm going to be honest, guys. I don't actually know what anything in that joke means. I'm just trying to win over some of these white people who don't have a leader anymore. So, yeah, honestly speaking, I think Trump not being included in this club is for the best because one of these guys is going to talk about, you know, everybody can agree being a president is one of the hardest jobs in the world. Am I right?  Tell me about it, dude. Sometimes I would have to work 12 hours a month. It was excruciating. And while I understand that people want to pretend Trump didn't exist, the truth is he did."}]}

I'm that beat. And I'm Helen Hong. And every week we take a look at a different occupation that is now jobs elite on our new podcast called, you guessed it, Jobs Elite.  Check it out on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  In the time that I've been here, I've been following the presidential race and I've noticed that a few pieces of conventional wisdom have formed around the candidates, none more than with Donald Trump.  Six in 10 Americans believe Trump is unqualified to serve as president, is not qualified to be president, unfit to be president, unfit to be commander in chief.  The Des Moines Register writing that Trump is, quote, not only unfit to hold office, but unfit to stand on the same stage as his Republican opponents.  He's unfit for that stage.  No, that stage is unfit for Trump. And there's no marble. There's no gold where the woman in bikinis and how would even get there?  There's no escalator. Come on, people. So the complaints about Trump is that he's unpresidential and it stems from certain statements that he's made when Mexico sends its people, they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists.  And some, I assume, are good people.  And you know what they say when you assume you're the best. But assuming Trump.  I know these comments about immigrants were upsetting to some people, but for me as an African, there's just something familiar about Trump that makes me feel at home.  The influx of illegal migrants climb unfair business practices, drugs.  It is also not true that all foreign nationals are involved in criminal activities. There are some who are, but not all of them. I love how we all waited, like, oh, he's not that South African President Jacob Zuma sounding a lot like Donald Trump. You see, that's like xenophobia with just a dash of diplomacy, which is also the title of Paula Dean's new book. So I don't see what's unpresidential about Donald Trump. I mean, here's has another thing he unnecessarily took heat for.  Autism has become an epidemic. The beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick. Now is autistic now.  Was that factual? No. But was it presidential, depends where you come from. Gambian President Yanmei says he can cure AIDS using herbs and bananas. He admits there will always be skeptics, but he says, quote, Mine is not an argument. Mine is a proof. It's a declaration. I can cure AIDS and I will.  That's right. That is right. The president of Gambia says he can cure AIDS with bananas and I can also cure cancer using AIDS, if only I had and cured all that AIDS are crazy things.  Better safe than sorry. What I'm trying to say is Donald Trump is presidential. He just happens to be running on the wrong continent in face.  In fact, once you once you realize that Trump is basically the perfect African president, you start to notice the similarities everywhere, like the level of self-regard.  I say not in a braggadocios way. I've made billions and billions of dollars.  I made a tremendous amount of money. I'm really rich. I have a great temperament. They love me anyway. I don't have to do this. I've done an amazing job.  I was born with a certain intellect. God helped me by giving me a certain brain.  I bet that's the one time that God's like, I don't need the praise. It's cool. That's you. That's you. I'm cool.  Now, is that extraordinary level of bragging presidential? Well, let's ask a man who actually was president, Idi Amin, former president and best president of Uganda.  The people love me very much. I'm very popular, them, very powerful. I am the one who has got the money. I have got a bit of good brain.  I have a very good brain and I know this because every time I ask people if I have a good brain, they say, of course, Mr. President, now please let my family go. You've already killed my sister. I think you've proved your point.  And just to make sure everyone knew exactly how successful he was, Idi Amin insisted on always being referred to by his full title. And this is completely true. His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Alhaji, Dr. Idi Amin, Dada VCDs. So M.C., Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conker of the British Empire in Africa in general and Uganda in particular.  Luckily, Idi Amin didn't own any casinos. In Trump is so African presidential, he's already at the level of Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, whose brutality and repressive tactics have kept him in power for thirty five years.  My people have great praise for me. People love me. Everybody loves me, the little man. He's very low energy plan.  He's ours. He's not European. It's our land. And we have taken it will take our country back.  We will we we will be with me all the time. We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning. I feel like I'm winning right now. It's really great to know that if anything ever happens to Trump, we have a backup coffee in Africa. I like that, actually.  Now that I think about it, Trump reminds me of one African leader in particular. We had here check lavish lifestyle, check fringe discredited views about President Obama's origins.  McGlothin us with us.  And along came a black citizen of Kenyan African origin, a Muslim. His name is Obama.  Check. Oh, and there's one more thing, Gadhafi put up a tent in the town of Bedford, about 40 miles outside of New York City. The property in Westchester County where they're setting up that tent, is owned by none other than Donald Trump.  Yeah, that's right, when Moammar Gadhafi came to America, he could have stayed anywhere, but the only place he felt truly at home was in Donald Trump's yard.  Now, just by the way, our lawyers told us we have to mention that Trump told Gaddafi to take the tent down. And you see, you have to be careful what you say about Donald Trump in public, not unlike an African president's.  I understand that Trump is a little scary. A little exotic for some a little out of America's comfort zone, but this great country is capable of bold leaps. It took one in 2008 when it elected its first black president, now in twenty sixteen. I say it's time to be bold once more and elect America's first African presidents.  And when that happens, when a true African finally enters the Oval Office, the people of Africa will erupt into songs of praise, cower in the darkness, who will win when it never ends? They've got to see this Ballandean Mexican rapists.  We don't have a word for Mexican rapists.

It's the reason you were able to watch crude's two on opening day in your bathtub and now there's actually some good pandemic news for a change. People cases in the US are dropping steeply for the first time ever.

I mean, partying at like the coolest orchards. I mean clubs. I go to the clubs, you know, don't I don't pick apples. And while there are still problems distributing the vaccine, some medical providers are getting creative to make sure that not a single dose goes to waste.  A snowstorm that's snarled traffic in Oregon ended up being a blessing in disguise for drivers who ended up being in the right place at the right time. That is because also stranded in that very same storm was a group of health care workers who had been administering vaccines. The workers had six doses with them and were worried the doses would go bad before they made it back. So they started giving out vaccines to others. Among those who were vaccinated was a sheriff's office employee who had been trying to get to the vaccine site when the storm hit.  OK, now that that's a pretty dope story, imagine being caught in a storm and looking into a covid vaccine that is officially the best thing to happen on a road in Oregon. I mean, normally when you get stuck up, they just die of dysentery. Then you got to restock. Now, some of the drivers, they just chose not to get vaccinated. And honestly, I get that. I mean, if some stranger in a van offered to give me a shot, I would also say, no, I learned that lesson when I was a kid.  Yeah, you can really fool me so many times, Mr. Berry. You know my uncle. But I do think that there's an important lesson here for everyone. Whenever there's a blizzard, get in your car and drive around until you stumble on someone with extra vaccines. And that, my friends, is Trevor's safety tip of the day. Moving on to travel news, if you're already planning your first post pandemic vacation, maybe you've been thinking about a flight to Paris to visit the museums or a trip to New York to see Broadway or a trip to Narnia, because you don't know that that's not a real place.  Well, for some real adventure seekers, they're planning a way more unique getaway.  And three very rich men will make up the first crew of private citizens to blast off to the International Space Station. It will cost each of them fifty five million dollars to fly on a SpaceX rocket and spend eight days on the orbiting lab next year. The men were introduced yesterday. They are 70 year old real estate entrepreneur Larry Conner of Ohio. He will be the second oldest person to fly in space. The chief executive of a Canadian investment firm, Mark Patte, will also be part of the crew, as will Israeli businessmen.  A stieber. They will be led by a former NASA astronaut. Wow.  Fifty five million dollars for an eight day vacation. And that doesn't even count the seven million they had to pay for a checked bag. But it does sound amazing. You know, I mean, part of me wishes I could be up there with them looking down at the earth at the moment. They realize that they spend fifty five million dollars to have to catch their poop before it floats away.  Another question I have is, have these people never watched movies in space? Something always goes wrong. And when it does, I don't know if it's going to help to have a real estate entrepreneur on board. Oh, my God, there's a killer alien headed straight towards us. Let's raise its rent by seven percent, which is higher than the standard five. That'll show it. We're so dead.  And finally, remember three weeks ago when a mob of Trump supporters tried to overthrow the government?  Remember that? Wow. Oh, so random, right. Well, anyway, investigators are now examining if parts of the attack were planned in advance by the proud boys. And we don't know yet how investigators are getting the information. But now we're learning that at least in the past, one of the proudest boys hasn't been too proud to squeal to the cops.  We have some new details to share with you about the leader of the right wing group, the boys. According to court documents obtained by Reuters, Enrique Toria was an informant for both the FBI and also local police in Miami. Now, it was part of a plea deal that he made after a 2012 arrest for fraud, according to court transcripts. Former and former prosecutor, the thirty six year old helped with several cases ranging from drugs to human trafficking. You may recall Torrio was arrested in the days that led up to that capital riot.  Torrio denied working with police and said, quote, I don't recall any of this.  Are you kidding me right now? The founder of the Cowboys is a snitch man, fascist bigots just aren't as trustworthy as they used to be.  The story's insane people. These dudes just stormed the capital and now they're finding out that their leader has got the FBI on speed dial when the next board meeting is going to be hella awkward.  Item one on the agenda, snitches get stitches. Item two, where are we hosting our virtual Christmas party this year, guys? Doug's mom said we can't use their virtual basement. I also love how he's like, I don't recall any of this. My dude being an FBI informant isn't the kind of thing you'd forget is like being asked if you're a virgin.  No one's like, am I? Well, let me think. I hang out with that one lady a lot. Wait, no, that was my mom. So that doesn't count.  Although to be fair to this guy, I get why someone in a hate group like the boys would want to work with the FBI. He probably sort them out like, hey, I heard your crew try to kill Martin Luther King Junior game recognizes game. But let's move on to the big story that everyone is still talking about, the GameStop stock explosion. You know, it's the reason your fourteen year old cousin just bought a Ferrari. Traders on Reddit sent the stock soaring this week, causing billions in losses for the hedge funds that bet against the video game retailers stock.  And today, Wall Street decided enough was enough. And this is a Fox News alert.  Now draw your attention to Main Street, where GameStop and AMC shares have been tumbling and trading action today as a growing number of firms move to halt trading on some stocks boosted by amateur traders on Reddit. The action is so wild that TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have restricted trading of these stocks. Wells Fargo also banning its advisors from telling clients to buy or sell GameStop and AMC.  Now, the criticism centered on Robideau for abandoning their followers here in favor of helping those who had shorted all these spots in the first place.  I don't particularly like the move on Robin Hood today. I'm talking to people this morning that say, OK, that is anticapitalism, you can't do that. A class action complaint was just filed in the Southern District of New York against Robin Hood. And this is what part of it says, and I'm quoting purposefully, willfully and knowingly, Robin Hood, remove the stock GME GameStop from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise. Thereby it goes on manipulating the open market.  Yeah, that's right, people. Wall Street was getting rocked so hard by average people buying stock in GameStop that they just stopped average people from buying it.  Yeah, the same guys, the same guys who are always like the markets must never be regulated. They must always remain free.  Those same guys are now like, oh, shit, the poor people got a hold of the freedom to turn it off, turn off the freedom. So thanks to this, Ben, the GameStop stock that a lot of people bought for a ton of money is now worth a lot less, which is probably familiar to anyone who sold a used game back to GameStop. So right now, a lot of people are understandably upset about what Wall Street is doing.  In fact, it's bringing together people from all sides.  I mean, Alsi and Ted Cruz are as far apart as Madison and Austin, and even they're both blasting the Robinhood app for blocking users from buying GameStop stocks. Everyone's mad. Even people like Jaru, Jaru, who tweeted, yo, this is what Robin Hood is doing, do not sell. And let me tell you something. When the guy who did the fire festival thinks that you're a fraud man and you're doing some shady shit now, please don't get me wrong.  This story is huge and it's complicated. So complicated that we wanted to bring on someone to talk about it more with us to help you and me understand. So earlier today, I spoke to Doug Henwood. He's an expert on the intersection between economics and politics. He's also the host of a radio show called Behind the News and the author of Wall Street How It Works and For Whom. We talked about the whole GameStop surge and what's really going on behind the curtain.  Doug Henwood, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Good to be here from a distance. Yes. Yes, indeed.  And it's it's a perfect time for you to be here. You have really established yourself as somebody who is not just aware of the market and participates in the market, but also calls Wall Street out for what it really is. The biggest story right now is GameStop, Wall Street hedge funds and just a lot of money that is no way and yet everywhere in the shortest way possible. How would you break this down to somebody who had no idea what was going on?  Most people, most civilians who don't really know the markets very well have the sense that it's all a big racket, kind of ludicrous, not that different from the casino, but all this is. Is that Wall Street likes to cultivate about itself that it's rational or is it allocating capital efficiency and all that efficiently and all that? It's just nonsense. It's not doing any of those things. It does a little of it. But mostly it's just a game to try to outwit your competitors and people on the other side of a trade, whatever, and run away with the most money.  It's just there's nothing terribly rational. It's driven by emotions and psychology and fear. And most recently, over the last year or so, by a gusher of something like three trillion dollars in Federal Reserve money, which is been power, the market. So it's that sense that a lot of people have that this is all a bit of a racket is completely accurate.  So it seems like like you're saying, it's like basically people came into the casino and said, we're going to play against the house and we're going to make a lot of money. What's interesting here is a market that is oftentimes termed free and capitalistic has now been stopped. Can you explain that? Why why was why was it stopped? Have these people broken the rules? Have they have they done anything wrong?  Well, I think there are a couple of things going on. One is these predators, they're just the wrong kind of people, but they're playing the same game that Wall Street does and they're getting together, talking up a stock, talking down a stock, trying to figure out the other guy's positions, looking who's weak, attacking them. They do Wall Street professionals do this sort of thing all the time. And I think it's very funny to hear their professions of outrage that this is just not moral.  You know, it's not fair. It's like the markets are supposed to be on the up and up and these guys are not playing fair. That's just utter nonsense. They're just the wrong kind of people. But I think the other thing is. Yeah, are they just trying to protect their own? And Robin Hood a little likes to present itself as a democratic institution.  The democratic broker for the masses are going to overturn the Wall Street order. It's deeply plugged into the Wall Street establishment. That's how they make their money. They feed their orders to establish brokers who then make money on those trades by taking a little a little bit of the price.  So I think they are trying to make the market, but they're also trying to keep the fences up, make sure the rabble can't crash the party.  So then two questions. One, what does this tell us about Wall Street and the market and to what do we do to improve this because it feels like an unfair system?  Well, it is an unfair system. It's a deeply unfair system. And one of the things that make me suspicious about all this talk of democratizing the stock market is that the distribution of income and wealth is very undemocratic. And there's nothing that you can do about that, nothing that a trading platform can do to change any of that. I mean, the fundamentals of the society are not going to change because some people in red, it got to play in the stock market.  But what does it tell you about Wall Street? It is largely of little economic significance.  The standard story is that the stock market exists to raise money for productive corporations, to invest in capital equipment, buildings, hire people, do R&D.  It does almost none of that. The market really is more about extracting value from companies. For shareholders. It's it really is a machine for extracting value. For the top one percent of society, the ownership of stocks is extremely concentrated. Something like ninety five percent of all stocks are owned by the richest five percent. And, you know, if you guys aren't ready, they're really not going to change that fundamental fact.  So for those people who are on rent, it's, you know, for the people who came in because they liked that, you know, that GameStop got a new CEO. You know, those people who who actually wanted to invest, the people who said, I believe in a future or screw the hedge funds, what position they and now I mean, are they at risk of losing a lot of money now or are they in a position where they've made so much from the initial investment that if they get out, they're generally going to be fine?  Yeah, I think you're going to exit a position. You just can't start a new one, which is somewhat reasonable. OK, but, you know, I think some some people are going to really lose a lot of money if people who are sensible enough sold into this rally. You know, if you bought it at 50 or 100 and sold it three hundred or three hundred and fifty, you're doing pretty nicely. But just looking at the chart for trading in GameStop today, it was, you know, went from something like three hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty.  You know, during the course of the day, it's been an utterly crazy, wild ride. None none of it makes much sense at all."}]}

OK, now I've got one word for you, Tom Cruise, on this new weekly podcast meeting, Tom Cruise.  We're going to talk about Tom Cruise. Everyone who's met him is an amazing story to tell. Hey, everybody. I'm Jeff Meacham of TV's Blackfish. I'm Joel Johnston from the marvelous Mrs. Masel. We are inspired by Tom Cruise, but we've never actually met Tom Cruise. But after we talk to some people who have, maybe we finally will. It's not impossible.  Listen to meeting Tom Cruise on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.  Listen to his A.J. and his TAMBINI. And we're giving great, bad advice. No, we're giving bad, great advice on our new show. We Talk Back. Yeah. Talking about a whole lot of sex. I love the sex a and a bunch of money. We love the money and relationships. We don't work on it. It feels like yours. And listen to we talk back every Thursday on the radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your back is.  Meet Marjorie Taylor Green in Congress, she represents Georgia's 14th District right outside Atlanta. And in life, she represents some views right outside of reality.  Marjorie Taylor Green, she won her house race for a district in northwest Georgia. She has in the past promoted that and on conspiracy theories.  Q is a patriot. We know that for sure, but we do not know who Q is. People believe that. Q is someone very close to President Trump. According to him, many in our government are actively worshipping Satan or they call mullock. I mean, is it going to be true that the child pedophilia and the elites in the Washington DC? Is that what we're really going to see come out? Is it going to be satanic worship?  Q Was in the House of Representatives. Now, Marjorie Taylor Green is hardly the first member of Congress to hold some out of their beliefs. I mean, Ted Cruz believes that beard is working for him. But Kuhnen is not just extreme. It's delusional people. How are you going to be in the government and believe that the government is full of Satan worshipping sex predators?  I mean, it must be exhausting to be walking around the halls of Congress just constantly opening doors like, ha, no, just a supply closet that, you know, just a copy room. But, you know, that's my office, man. I'm so lost. And it's not just Kuhnen. In fact, it seems like Green has a conspiracy theory for every letter of the alphabet.  The Trump backing Republican embraces completely false Kuhnen conspiracy theories. And in a newly uncovered video from twenty eighteen claimed former President Obama is Muslim.  The Clintons had JFK Jr. killed and even questioned whether a plane crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11.  It's odd there's never any evidence shown for a plane and the Pentagon. Facebook posts have surfaced in which Green called the deadly Parkland High School shooting fake, along with video showing her harassing Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg's. Why are you supporting Red? My gun laws that attack our Second Amendment right? How do you get avid gun owners and people that support the Second Amendment to give up their guns and go along with anti-gun legislation? How do you do that? Maybe you accomplished that by performing a mass shooting into a crowd that is very likely to be conservative.  Is that what happened in Las Vegas?  Have you seen the picture of Ruth Bader Gingrich walking through the airport?  Yeah, like my body double for Hillary Clinton. So it's interesting. So I do not believe that was raised. No, I don't think so. I don't know.  Wow. OK, so RBG has a body double. Hillary Clinton has a body double. This one makes it sound like everyone has their own body double. I mean, that's such a silly thing to believe you over the weekend they're on to us.  Get out of there and roar. But the big question is, how did Osama bin Karen get elected to Congress in the first place? Well, it turns out she was lucky to be one of nine Republicans running for the seat. So everyone's attention was spread around instead of focused all on her. Kind of like how there are so many different kinds of orio now that you hardly even noticed that one of the flavors is human flesh. And while some of the Kulen stuff did come out, mostly what voters knew about her was that she was a hardcore Trump supporter, and yet she sometimes sounded like a crazy person, but only in a comforting, familiar way.  She's a former trusted gym owner who has had a few roles at her father's construction company, but really has no political background at all.  America is the greatest country in the world. We need conservatives in Washington that will keep it that way. The Democrat Party is no longer an American party. They are now the party of socialism. They want to rip our borders wide open. They want to kill babies up until birth and maybe even afterwards. I have a message for antifa terrorists. Stay the hell out of northwest Georgia Goddam.  I know which house I'm skipping on Halloween. And by the way, everyone is freaking out about Greens Kulen beliefs. But if you ask me, the scary cult she's involved in is Crosthwaite. I mean, that's just just Scientology with jumping jacks. But yes, aside from the cult stuff, a lot of Greens beliefs are pretty typical for today's Republicans.  But she also has a little extra something that makes the far right love her even more.  It's racism.  Marjorie Taylor Green also has a track record of incendiary and racist rhetoric. There is an Islamic invasion into our government offices right now.  If you want Islam and Sharia law, you stay over there in the Middle East, you stay there and you're going to Mecca and do all your thing. And you know what? You can have a whole bunch of wives or goats or sheep or whatever you want.  But that doesn't make me a racist because I disagree. As I say, leave the statue up there. The most mistreated group of people in the United States today are white males.  When a now deleted Facebook post green question whether California's deadly campfire in twenty eighteen was started by lasers beamed down from outer space lasers, she says, somehow connected to the Rothschilds, the Jewish European banking family, the target of some of the oldest, laziest, most dangerous anti-Semitic tropes on the books, Jewish space lasers.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. Jewish space lasers. What is this lady just playing? Conspiracy slot machine.  I'm going with whatever comes up because here's my question.  If you were secretly starting a forest fire, why would you use a space laser when you could just use, I don't know, matches? It's such a waste of a Jewish space laser.  It's like using the Death Star to make s'mores, make sure their toaster. And honestly, guys, if you're anti Semitic, this is a weird way to try and get people on your side, because when I hear someone saying Jews have a space laser, I'm like, awesome, can I join? I will say, though, it is impressive that Green has some wild racist theory for every group. I mean, no wonder she got elected because she's like, I want to be a congresswoman for everyone, whether you hate Jews, blacks, Muslims or filthy Canadians, I'm on your side.  So that's who Margery Taylor Greene was before she started threatening to kill Democrats. And her calls for violence are nothing new. While some Republicans only came around to supporting an insurrection after Donald Trump lost the election, Green was rallying the troops even before November twenty twenty.  If this generation doesn't stand up and defend freedom, it's gone. And once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself. The only way you get your freedoms back is that it's earned with the price of blood.  When we rise up, we can end all of this. We can end it. We can do it peacefully, we can. I hope it doesn't have to we don't have to do it the other way. I hope not, but we should feel like we will if we have to.  OK, guys, I'm sorry, but calls for a violent revolution just don't have the same weight when you're streaming from your hotel room. It's time for the people to rise up and take back their freedoms.  Excuse me, can I get another towel, please? Because I'm going to the pool. Yeah. Thank you so much.  Less spill some blood. No, the cabana will be fine. Thank you. So now that all these death threats and conspiracy theories have come to light, Congress is trying to figure out how to deal with Greene. Do you censure her? Do you expel her? Do you use a secret Jewish space laser to distract her like a cat? I mean, one thing's for sure, while Congress tries to decide what to do with her, she's out there getting stuff done herself.  Georgia Congressman Marjorie Taylor Green calling on President Biden to be impeached, found articles of impeachment on President Joe Biden.  We'll see how this goes. What a letdown. Marjorie Taylor Green came to Washington calling for executions and a few weeks later, she's already settling for impeachment. Man, I guess Congress will turn anyone into a moderates. But you know what? I have a conspiracy theory of my own. I think Marjorie Taylor Greene is secretly a Democrat.  You know, think about it. She's making Republicans look unhinged. She's from Georgia, which we all know is a blue state. And she's a member of Congress, which she herself believes is a satanic demonic cult. Now, if I'm correct and Marjorie Taylor Greene is a Democrats, well, that's great news for everyone, because that would be the only way that Republicans would actually want to hold her accountable for anything she's done.  The Post by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez gave a harrowing account of her personal experience during the capital attack.  We're getting an eye opening new look inside last month's siege on the U.S. capital. Ocasio Cortez describing the impact of the riots, sharing details about what happened to her during the insurrection at the capital, telling her viewers she felt like she was going to die.  All of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on my door like this, like I'm here.  And the bathroom door starts going like this, like the bathroom door is behind me or rather in front of me. And I'm like this. And the door hinges right here. And I just hear, where is she?  Where is she?  And this was the moment where. I thought everything was over, you know, I just happened to. You know, be a spiritual person and be raised in that context, and I really just felt like, you know. If this is the plan for me. Then people will be able to take it from here. Wow. You know, for a lot of us at home, the capital riots were basically an action movie on TV. I mean, it was scary, intense and terrifying, but at the end of the day, we were just watching it.  But an action movie is very different when you are actually in the movie. I mean, AOC and other members of Congress literally thought that they were going to die on a Wednesday afternoon, no less. I mean, nobody should die in the middle of the week. That means you went to work on Monday and Tuesday for nothing. And thank God that no members of Congress were actually hurt. But even just believing that you're going to die is a major trauma.  And ABC handled it way better than I would have. I mean, she was like, if this is where my journey ends, so be it. If I thought about it, I wouldn't be pondering my journey. I'd be trying to delete my browser history. And to everyone out there who's saying, oh, how scared could she really have been? How scared could she have been? Think about how terrified you get when someone knocks on the bathroom door when there isn't even a riot.  Someone in here? Oh, God, no. They're going to know that I poop. So I'm glad that ABC shed the story because many Republicans in Congress would like to just pretend that the shit never happened, that the lives of Congress members and their staff weren't in danger, and that police officers guarding the Capitol weren't injured and killed. But if there's no accountability, then it becomes easier and easier for it to happen again. And the last thing we need from this action movie is a sequel.  My name is Redock, I am Ellen Bernstine Brodsky. This is on your grandmother. What's the matter with you?  Well, when it is a podcast about the relationship between grandmothers and grandchildren, as my mother would have said, TACA, who wouldn't have wanted a Jewish grandmother?  Sometimes she accidentally live streams were like, who? Who's going to tell her?  I'm just hearing about this now. Listen to your grandmother on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  Hi, it's Laverne Cox and my new podcast, Laverne Cox Show, we're ripping the Band-Aid off trauma, resilient, dating, diet, culture, dating, white supremacy, dating, OK, I'm not going to get explicit, but just because you cute like I'm not going I'm not.  You're going to say yes, girl and honey, we have a lot of fun along the way.  You have a lot of lesbian fans who love your femininity and glamour, and they just really, really want you.  And I want us to talk openly about the difficult things we all face as humans and as humans in America.  Racist white people in the United States will sign their own death certificates. They will vote for policies that crush them. No safety nets, no health care, because they feel too much like entitlements. And those are folks of color. Right.  Listen to the Laverne Cox Show and the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast, make sure you subscribe and share.  Washington, D.C., home of America's sharpest penis ever since metal detectors were installed outside the House of Representatives in the wake of the Capitol riots, Republicans have been causing a scene by trying to sneak past with their own guns. And it's gotten so bad that Democrats had to finally lay down the law fines for House members who refused to pass through new metal detectors. The five thousand dollar fine for a first offense and a ten thousand dollar fine after that will be deducted straight from lawmakers salaries.  Every Republican present voted against this new rule proposed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the wake of the Capitol insurrection. Some Republicans, like Louie Gohmert of Texas, Lauren Bobert of Colorado and Andy Harris of Maryland, they have already tried to defy these new security screenings.  Who you've got to admit, man, these Republicans have got some balls. They really out here like I need my guns. This place is dangerous. Any minute now, I could incite another riot. Look, man, there is no reason that any member of Congress should need a gun on the floor of the House. None. OK, maybe, except Louie Gohmert. I mean, he needs his gun for hunting wabbits. Look, I hope that these fines will finally force Republicans to behave themselves.  On the other hand, though, bringing your gun in and paying the fine anyway might just be the way Republicans flex from now on. Just be walking around like, yeah, that's right. I got that metal detector money, bitch. Speaking of the insurrection, one thing that set it off was the conspiracy theory that the Democrats stole the election using rigged voting machines from the company Dominion. It's a conspiracy theory that was pushed by Trump supporters like Mike Lyndell, the My Pillow founder and ultraright Morio and the right wing network.  Newsmax talked about it all the time.  But last month, Dominion finally told Newsmax, Yo, if you don't get our name out of your mouth, we're going to sue your Channel three forty nine ass network into oblivion. And based on what happened yesterday when Lyndell tried to go back on Newsmax, the network is taking that threat seriously."}]}

It's because of these ideas starting to germinate, lifting people up, maybe have just a little gratitude for them and maybe have a little room to say.  Maybe the entire story of this three hundred year miracle isn't a story of purely of oppression and tyranny where we bad the bad things happen in the past.  Yes. Have things been getting better? Yes, you can say both things.  You can say both things nuanced. The way I'd like to think of it as this I go. Capitalism in many ways should be like software on a phone. It constantly needs to be updated and at some points it feels like the updating has stopped and people allow it to stagnates in the way that it is.  And to your point of gratitude, before I let you go, I think the one thing and I wonder if you can maybe understand this is when people say you should be grateful for what you have.  Do you not think that gratitude is always relative to the bottom versus the top in where you are? Because to say to somebody and you hear this all the time and I'm not saying U.S. politicians will say, oh, black people, you complain about America, go live in Afghanistan, see what that's like. I said, but you're not living in Afghanistan. If I'm in a Michelin star restaurant and the food is not great, you can't tell me to go to Arby's because I complain, right?  I'm saying to you, the food is not what it was promised in this restaurant. So is it not difficult to say to people who have gratitude?  When they are not living in the promise of what the country is meant to be, yeah, I think that that's fair. I think at the same time. So I don't say that to people.  Right. You know, honestly, I'm so and so I'm one of the you one of the good ones.  One of the things I for one of the things look, I mean, I've I've taken slings and arrows from lots of different directions, including from a lot of friends and former friends positions I've taken.  One of the things I would say to people who make that argument is stop making that argument. Right. Right. You know, that's not how you should frame this kind of thing. What I would say is that, you know, the the pursuit of happiness is, is it's not a guarantee. Have the right to pursue it. And one of the great things about. Freedom, the miracle, liberal democratic capitalism, whatever you want to call it, is it gives more people the opportunity to pursue it.  Could that get better?  Yeah, but you can't look at any of the systems we had prior to three hundred years ago.  And I'm not sure you can look at to most of the sort of nationalist or socialist systems and say they're better at it. Right. And so when people say we fall short of ideals, I said, well, of course, that's why they call them ideals.  You're not supposed to be able to like live. They're supposed to be a north star. You know, the thing that your true north that you march towards could always get better at them.  My point is, is that we shouldn't throw them away because this is the only game in town in terms of of what has actually taken humanity out of the muck of its natural environment.  Capitalism is unnatural. Democracy is unnatural.  If they were natural, you would think they would show up a little earlier in the evolutionary record than about two hundred ninety nine thousand years into our existence here.  And so maybe these are things that we should be a little more protective of.

It's not really so much about greed. It's about ingratitude.  It says I think fundamentally I understand what you're saying and that's what I appreciate about the book, is it makes me think that it engages in ideas. And fundamentally, what the book is saying is don't throw the baby out with the bath. That's right. That's right. And we can we can disagree about the size of government, all these kinds of things.
