Now, it's been 30 years since the first episode of Beverly Hills, 1981, OK, 30 years since we walk the halls of West Beverly High and since we all hung out at the Peach Pit, relive it all with Jenny Garth and Tori Spelling on their new podcast, Two and OMG. We get to tell the fans all of the behind the scenes stories that actually happened to them as they watch every episode of the beloved 90s TV show from the very beginning.  Listen to Ninio two and OMD on the I Heart radio app or wherever you get your podcasts.  Are you going to filibuster me or because I don't have all the time you want me to be very good. So is this like a roundabout way of saying you just want me to give a short pithy. No, I don't want your question. You want me to speed up? You want me to talk fast?  No, no, no, no. Please, Mr. President, I will not I will not purposely filibuster, but sometimes I will have a pause as I'm formulating my thoughts. As you well know, Michelle, Michelle has been speeding up my auto my my audio book. So, you know, I guess you can press a button. So, yeah. You like point two, five or one and a half. Yes. Yeah. Well, yeah, you were one and a half guy.  You did want to talk.  I was a little offended by that, but that's okay. That's fine.  It does, it doesn't communicate the depth of feeling with which I'm doing the reading but it's OK.  How do you like being referred to.  Like just as a human being. Do you like Mr. President?  People call me Barack, but then sometimes some folks feel awkward doing it. Obviously, that's what my friends call me. So I consider you a friend, but you may feel, you know. So no, no, no.  The people the people will feel like like even Africans will. They'll write me a letter saying, how dare you, this is my fault, too.  So I don't want to get you in trouble. So you can say, Mr. President, makes sense. You can call me Protus.  My favorite one was. Oh, Bizzle. That was my favorite. Please call me that. Mr. President, welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.  I am very happy to be here with you. You're out there promoting a brand new book, A Promised Land, a seven hundred page book, if I may add. I love reading your stuff. Don't get me wrong. But like I would have liked three fifty three fifty.  Why seven hundred pages, you know, I would have, I would have broken it up even more. But, you know, the publishers thought that breaking it up into two volumes would be about right. And look, the goal of the book was to give people a sense of what it's like to be in the White House. Right. As a normal person, finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. And I think part of the goal, particularly for young people, I wanted them to get a sense that, you know, not everybody is going to end up being president.  But if you decide that your voice makes a difference, if you decide that you can have an impact, then through the ups and downs, you will end up having some pretty extraordinary experiences. And one, I wanted to be an encouragement for people to say, you know, the guy is OK, but he's not so special and look what he ended up doing. Maybe I can do something, something as well.  It feels like this book is Barack Obama convincing Barack Obama to remain optimistic? And what I mean by convincing Barack Obama, I think of like a young Barack Obama, I think of a fledgling Barack Obama. I'm not trying to emulate you, per say, but rather anyone who's trying to make a change in the world or their world.  That's what that's what it feels like if you if you are writing to young people to be optimistic in the book.  What are some of the frustrations that you understand on this side that may hinder that optimism? Because if a young person says, yeah, but the system right now is crumbling more and more, how do you how do you maintain that optimism or do you think there has to be a point where they go? I'm not optimistic. I'm just fighting to break what it is to create something new.  Part of the reason that it's 700 pages long is because by reading the book, they'll see men. There are a lot of structural problems or barriers in making this place better.  We're learning right now in Vivid, a vivid example of the fact that our democracy is not the way we would imagine it to be. But there are all kinds of elements to it where the most votes don't necessarily translate into the equivalent amount of power. Very popular proposals can wither on the vine because of a filibuster in the Senate. And so I don't try to gloss those over.  You know, the Paris accord did not solve climate change, but it created the first global framework whereby all countries agreed, we have to do something about this and here's a mechanism to do it. You can still be terrified about the pace at which we are burning up the planet and yet think that was a worthwhile endeavor because it gives us at least the opportunity maybe three, four or five years down the road to keep building on that. So that is the kind of mentality I want young people to have a certain impatience, a certain frustration, a certain anger about the status quo.  There are times now where, you know, you have younger activists criticizing me for Obama. Why don't you take care of this or that or the other? And I, I welcome them feeling frustrated and impatient because that's how I was before I got started. And then they'll get their own knocks on the head and, you know, some stuff won't work out exactly the way they want. But the impulse. Is the one that I want to encourage, because it's as a consequence of that, that constant striving and imagining something better, that things don't get exactly as we want it, but they get better.  You're a very serious person because, I mean, you're a president of the United States, but at the same time, you're a lot more fun than a lot of people think.  You know, I'm constantly trying to explain to people I'm a funny guy, but but I don't know. But you're right. But you really are. You really, really are. And what I liked in the book is there are moments where there's just like a roasting of people or life like the G20. I've never I've never heard of a world leader. Describe the G20 the way you do in the book. The high school of it all. I wanted on a personal level, have you maintained connections with those world leaders as like like do you do you send Angela Merkel means do you like who are you still close with just as a human being?  You know, I don't send Angela Merkel names, but I talk to her sometime. Sometimes, you know, she'll give me a call, I'll give her a call and we'll trade notes. You have there are a handful of folks who you've been in the foxhole with.  Right. You've done some good, important work. Some of them are still in power. So I don't want to mention that, you know, that I'm giving them a call because I did get them in trouble. You mentioned something like an Angela Merkel look. You know, the stance she took in Europe relative to immigration. And the enormous political cost she paid for that, and yet there was something inside her that said, look, I'm not going to simply abandon a million people who are in desperate need.  You know, you see that in somebody and you say it, it encourages you that for all the cruelty and venality and corruption around the world, there are a lot of good people doing good work and some of them actually rise to significant positions of power. And in that sense, democracy can work the way it's supposed to. If. You know, we have a vigilant citizenry, and that's not always the case. You've started leadership programs not just in South Africa but all over the world.  The Obama Foundation has set about on a journey to inspire young people to grow up to become leaders growing up in South Africa. I was taught about the different levels of what a struggle is going to be. You know, the freedom fighters may not necessarily be the best politicians, the best politicians may not necessarily be the best leaders, the best activists may not be the best organizers and so on and so forth. Everyone has a role to play in trying to get to a certain place.  And so I wonder, when you set up these this leadership academy that's all over the globe, you know, you're clearly trying to create mini Obamas everywhere, which is probably like a fever dream of the right. But what you what you're trying to do is create something specific. And I would like to know what that is. What do you what do you believe a leader is not just somebody who's in power, but a leader?  The program we did in Johannesburg, we gathered up two hundred young leaders from 50 countries on the continent of Africa, and it was as varied. You had young women who had started rural health clinics. Yeah.  You had MPs who had taken a more conventional political route. You had entrepreneurs.  The thing they all had in common, though, was this this sense not only that the world could be better and that they had a role to play in it, but also the belief that they couldn't do it by themselves and that they had to in some ways unlock the potential and power of other people. A speech I gave in Johannesburg in conjunction with that is for the anniversary of Mandela's 100th anniversary where I contrasted that.  Sort of democratic, inclusive leadership to the strongman leadership that in some ways we've seen ascendant in certain parts of the world in some ways has was ascendant here in the United States.  And those are two different stories of what it means to be a leader and and power and that conflict, that battle between a more democratic, inclusive vision and one that's Top-Down dominant subordinate. That's a contest that's taking place here in the United States and around the world. And it's not going to be finished just because the election's over and Donald Trump was defeated because you see examples of this in the Philippines and Hungary in a variety of countries in Africa and Asia.  And so that that contest is going to continue.  What I find fascinating about the conversation that a lot of Americans are having now, and you talk about this in the book as well, is how America's influence in the world has diminished over the past few years, how how countries around the world have no longer said, what is America doing? We'll work with them. It's it's been more like, no, guys, we can't wait for America. We're doing our own thing. But I wonder, as somebody who has grown up in other parts of the world, as someone who has family in other parts of the world, is there an argument that maybe that's a good thing, that the world doesn't follow America anymore?  Or what what would the what would the inverse of that argument be like? Should the world follow America or is it time for the world to start doing its own thing? And America should be less the world police, I think.  It is a good thing that other countries catch up and have their own capabilities and their own agency. That's not something that I think America should fear. My argument would be that even in a more multipolar world where you don't have just one big power, but you have other countries who are coming into their own, the principles that America articulated at its best about rule of law, human rights, freedom of speech, democracy, those values, at least I choose to believe, are not exclusively American.  If you as somebody who lived in South Africa, you know, the the the play that in other countries, sometimes you hear where somebody who's doing something entirely for power and money and influence will say if they're criticized, you say, you know, you've been just influenced by Western thinking that that's colonial thinking.  No, no, no, no. You are stealing from your people don't. And when we criticize, you don't don't claim that somehow this is some American hegemony being asserted against you. We're calling you on the fact that you're a thief. I think it's important for us to to to. To recognize that for all its failings, the values that America is often articulated on the world stage have been ones that I would still believe in and that a lot of people took comfort from.  And when we are not asserting them, oftentimes they don't you know, they don't play out on the world stage.  I sometimes wondered if you ever grappled with the difficulty of the paradox that America was creating and what it was trying to do in the world and then what its actions was sometimes creating in the world know. I mean, I think about that in the Middle East wars that have been started under false pretenses, people who have been killed, who had nothing to do, you know. And so I wonder, as someone who had to make decisions and someone who was in that leadership position, do you sometimes grapple with how America did or did not help itself in how it acted with the world?  Because in the world, like I'll tell you, as an international person, we would oftentimes go like men. Yes, America's great. And it's doing wonderful things. But then you'd be like, but also men. Sometimes they just break the rules and no one can say anything about it. Absolutely.  And I record examples in the book of where I'm grappling with this. Right. And one of the interesting challenges of being president, the United States. But I think being head of government or state in any country is you inherit a legacy. Right. So if I come in as president and. I can't undo the Iraq war, the decision to go into Iraq now, I can manage as best I can how we can wind down that war, mitigate some of the damage that's been done, but I can't reverse it.  Do you ever did you ever envy, though, how like Trump just came in and basically broke shit, though? Because, I mean, he didn't care?  No, I didn't envy it because I do care. And I do not think that is an option to simply pretend that the legacy of problems or issues that you inherit are somehow things you can just brush aside. So the answer is yes, I. I would struggle with the fact that any action I took, particularly when you're talking about. You know, counterterrorism, right? That's probably the area where I wrestled with this most because my obligation first and foremost.  In the United States was to make sure that people didn't get hurt. That's sort of the bare minimum that you expect out of a nation state that you're living in is that you can defend against harm because you're dealing with non-state actors. That meant that by the time I took office, you had networks that were embedded in societies not necessarily supported by those societies, but they're there and they are plotting and they're planning. And that wasn't made up. And there were organizations that if they could blow up the New York subway system, they would if they could get their hands on a biological weapon, they would use it.  You then are wrestling with how do I protect? The American people from those actors.  But do it in a way that is morally and ethically justified and war is madness, kinetic action of any sort, military action of any sort that results in death and destruction. At a certain level is not the thing I would want humanity to do and what happens to people is tragic. It is not it is not something you gloss over what what what it does to our soldiers and our troops. You know, as I talk about in the book, it's not just the harm that our young men and women suffered.  And I would witness in Walter Reed, but it's also how it changes them internally when they have engaged in violence, even if necessary and justified against others. So the best I could come up with was to never glorify it, to never pretend like it isn't a dilemma. And so those kinds of questions, I think, are ones that."}]}

I'm Trevor Noah and this is the Daily Social Distancing Show. Here's a tip for anyone out there who's trying to get the vaccine right now. You cannot get vaccinated by making out with everyone who has had the vaccine, but it's fun to try.  Call me Gladys. Anyway, on tonight's show, Tom Brady defeats the Packers and Father Time Roy Wood Junior defends the police and why you're the one who should really be impeached. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah. Here's a. Let's kick things off with the Super Bowl. It's the night you open a blue cheese dressing that you'll end up throwing away in April. Yesterday, the Kansas City Chiefs advanced to the big game where they'll be facing off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which means we're going to be seeing a very familiar, very handsome face on the field.  Now to the other big story this morning. Brady is back in the Super Bowl for the 10th time in his career. Tom Brady is headed to the championship game.  The NFL's elder statesman is facing off against one of the youngest in the league. Twenty five year old Kansas City superstar Patrick Mahomes, who took the Chiefs to victory at last year's Super Bowl. Touchdown. And get this. When Brady won his first Super Bowl in 2002, Mahomes was just six years old.  Tom Brady has obviously smashed all kinds of records. He becomes the oldest Super Bowl quarterback in history at forty three, surpassing Tom Brady two years ago when he won.  OK, no. Hell no. Tom Brady is immune from aging. How is he still winning at forty three? What is his secret? I'm only thirty six and all my Google searches are like tips make clicking sounds when I walk. Am I dying. But it kind of makes sense. I mean every sport has to have the one old guy, all of them. Even when you play pickup basketball, there's always that one guy with the gray hair and the Hard Rock Cafe shirt who shows you flames.  You spend the rest of the game debating if he's actually John Stockton or not. That is at every corner. But still, it is not fair that Tom Brady is this good and this handsome. He's going to be in his 10th Super Bowl and he looks like this.  No, that's why I'm starting a Kickstarter today to pay for him to get plastic surgery to look like this. It's only fair people. I mean, think about it. The opposing quarterback in the Super Bowl, Patrick Mahomes, was six years old when Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl. Being good for that long must change how you interact with kids. Tom Brady will see his friend's baby and just not trash talking it. Oh, if you think you're crying now, just wait until I whip your ass in twenty years.  But let's move on now to the big news out of Russia.  You know the country that's currently watching you through your computer camera. Last week, Opposition Leader Alexei Navalny returned to the country where he was immediately thrown in jail by Vladimir Putin's police. But what Putin might not have expected is this response.  Massive crowds gathered in cities across Russia on Saturday demanding Opposition Leader Alexei Navalny be released from jail. These were some of the biggest demonstrations in Russia in years.  Protests swept across Russia's 11 time zones, taking place in 90 cities in the capital, Moscow. An estimated fifteen thousand demonstrators gathered in the city center clashing with police.  Police in Moscow started making arrests even before the demonstrators started protesting. More than a thousand people were detained in the Russian capital alone, organizers say. 3000, they claim, nationwide, police with batons rushed through crowds of Navalny supporters who braved temperatures as low as minus 58 degrees. Some of the officers were seen beating the protesters. Some demonstrators fought back, including these people who guarded a group of riot police with snowballs in Moscow.  Wow. Nationwide, protests across 11 time zones against Putin. That's inspiring. Guys, can we agree on something? Anybody who protests in negative fifty eight degree weather should have their demands heard. The problem is that protests can get out of hand quickly when it's that cold because people would be like, let's burn down that store like that to protest Putin. No bitch for heat. But seriously, though, props to all of those protesters because they're putting a lot of pressure on Vladimir Putin and I mean, real pressure not to shower pressure.  These protesters are widespread enough that Putin can't just laugh them off. And yes, that's partly because Putin isn't sure of how to laugh. Ha ha.  Well, OK, start with smile then see how I go. And in many ways, Russia is just catching up with the mood of the moment. I mean, this has been a huge year for protests around the world. America saw the largest protests in its history against police brutality. We saw sors protests in Nigeria, Iraqis in the streets against corruption. Now, the Russian people, if you have a cause that you want to fight for, this is the year to do it.  People are amped up, maybe start a movement.  No single ply toilet paper.  Yeah. Yeah, I see that the people are ready to go, we're using our hands, no.  Oh, you know, moving on to the epic battle dominating the news, King Kong versus Godzilla. Why do you guys have to fight? Haven't you heard? This is a time for unity, but also the epic battle against the coronavirus.  Right now, things are not going great. The US has really been struggling to distribute enough vaccines. Hospitals are running short, appointments are getting cancelled. I mean, it's not as serious as the shortage of PlayStation five, but it's still pretty bad. And until people can get vaccinated, America is going to have to take even more serious steps to stop the spread of this virus.  This morning, the US will begin restricting travel from South Africa, banning most non US citizens who have recently traveled to the country from entering the state, as well as reimposing the travel ban for Brazil, the UK, Ireland and twenty six countries across Europe in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus.  The biggest change will put a new travel ban in place for people coming from South Africa, where a new virus strain has been identified.  Researchers are worried that the new variant might be better at evading antibodies and have greater resistance to vaccines.  OK, I know this is a terrible story, but I can't lie. And there's something in me that always gets excited whenever South Africa gets mentioned on international TV, even when it's about travel restrictions because of a highly contagious plague variant, I'm like, that's where I'm from.  Cool, I'm from there. But that's right. This new variant of coronavirus is the fastest, most deadly thing out of South Africa since Oscar Pistorius. So now America is closing down travel from South Africa. But honestly, I don't even understand why anybody would want to come to America right now. I mean, everything is closed. What are you going to do when you get here?  Oh, I can't wait to watch Netflix in a hotel room, just like I do at home, but this time with a view of Denny's. But let's move on to our main story.  And guys, it is so exciting that we can finally stop spending all our time talking about Donald Trump's presidency. Yes. Instead, we get to talk about cleaning up the mess from Donald Trump's presidency.  It's history in the making once again, as Capitol Hill prepares for the second Donald Trump impeachment trial. Once again, the House impeachment managers will take the long walk across the United States Capitol to deliver the one article of impeachment to the United States Senate.  The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial. But make no mistake, there will be a trial. And when that trial ends, senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Donald, John Trump incited the erection insurrection against the United States.  God damn. I knew the Democrats were hoping for Trump's impeachment, but that was ridiculous. And you could tell by the look on his face that Schumer knew that he had blown the entire case.  He incited this erection, dammit. I guess he gets to be president again. I'm sorry, everybody. Now, Trump's team doesn't even have to present a defense. They'll just be like, yo, you guys remember when Schumer said erection?  Oh, all right, guys, let's get out of here. And honestly, I can't blame them. I mean, come on, Schumer, how hard is it to not say the word erection? You can't afford to be making these kinds of rookie mistakes. You just defeated Donald Trump in a national direction. And you are, damn it. Now, the last time Donald Trump got impeached, most Republican senators said they wouldn't convict him because he hadn't done anything wrong.  But after the capital attack, they had to admit that, yes, maybe Trump actually did incites an insurrection, but they still don't want to impeach him because that will make his followers angry. And have you seen his followers? I mean, they staged an insurrection, which is why for this impeachment trial, Republican senators have found a loophole to let them dodge the issue entirely.  A chorus of criticism this morning from Republican senators ahead of former President Trump's impeachment trial, some arguing that since Donald Trump is out of office, it's out of their hands.  I think the trial is stupid. I think it's counterproductive. We already have a flaming fire in this country and it's like picking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire. A trial after the president has left office is beyond the Senate's constitutional authority. I think a lot of Americans are going to think it's strange that the Senate is spending its time trying to convict and removed from office a man who left office a week ago, if you can impeach a president after they're out of office.  I don't want peace. George Washington, he owned slaves. Where does this stop? OK, first of all, I support impeaching George Washington because I don't want that guy holding office again, a slave owning zombie as president. That's terrifying. But let's be real, man. This is one of the most ridiculous arguments ever. Trump committed crimes on his way out of the door. So what? The people just have to let it go.  The policy doesn't exist anywhere else. If you get fired at Best Buy, they don't just let you steal a TV on the way out. They don't even let you take that blue shirt with you. You walk out of there naked. In fact, you can argue that you have to convict Trump because if there's no consequence for trying to overthrow the government, then every president will just try it on their way out of office.  I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Suck the capital, boys. Oh, it didn't work. Well, I shot my shot. So you guys in four years, everybody now saying you can't impeach Trump because then you'd have to impeach George Washington is one thing, but one of Trump's top supporters hadn't even wilder arguments.  You can't impeach Trump because then you'd have to impeach everybody.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is facing backlash for new comments that he made in the wake of the deadly Capitol riot.  I thought the president had some responsibility would came to the response. If you listen to what president said at the rally, he said demonstrate peacefully. I also think everybody across this country has some responsibility. Think about four years ago after the President Trump was sworn in, what happened the very next day, the title was Resist with people walking in the street.  Everyone across the country is responsible. Everyone, whoa, whoa, whoa.  My men, my men don't bring me into this. I wasn't even near Washington. I was busy at home seeing if you could make waffles out of chocolate bars. And then I was busy calling the fire department because the answer is no. But this is unbelievable. The GOP is supposed to be the party of personal responsibility. Isn't that their thing? But as soon as their members do something wrong, they start talking like Buddhist's.  When you think of the oneness of all things, then Donald Trump is as guilty as the blooming flower or the flowing rhythm. If we convict Trump, we must convict nature herself.  Oh. Now, you might be asking, why is it so hard to find Republicans willing to hold Donald Trump responsible for his actions? Well, because it turns out that even out of office, Trump still has an incredible amount of power with Republican voters, and he's pennsy enough to use it against anybody who dares cross him.  The Washington Post reports Trump has entertain the idea of creating a third party called the Patriot Party and instructed his aides to prepare election challenges to lawmakers who crossed him in the final weeks in office, including Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski and South Carolina Republican Representative Tom Rice.  According to people familiar with the plans, he's still wanting to exert whatever pressure he can over the Republican senators who still don't control the fate of his presidency. That's now over. But they do control whether Donald Trump goes down in history as the first president or former president ever to be convicted in an impeachment trial. So I think Trump is looking for any kind of power that he can still exert over Republicans. That's right, people.  Trump is threatening to form a new political party as a way to punish Republicans who betray him. And, you know, he's serious because he made Jared Kushner Google how to start a political party. This shit is on. And by the way, it seems unfair to get to pick a name for your party like Patriot Party, because you got to wait until everyone else picked boring words. And then you just jump in like, oh, you guys are Democrats and Republicans.  Cool will be the Explosive Orgasmed Party. And I'll be honest, I don't actually get Donald Trump. He just left his job and he's already out here trying to form new parties and threaten senators.  I thought if there's anyone who would enjoy retirement, it's Donald Trump. I mean, he's basically already been retired for the last four years and takes some time off enjoying Florida, play some golf, spend some time with your. You know what? Actually, I get it now.  You probably want to run again. But the truth is, Trump doesn't even need to start a third party because he's already made the GOP the Trump Party. He's basically an erection. I mean, infection, dammit, man. Trump is an infection that took over the Republican Party.  And it turns out they are already new mutant strains of Trump virus cropping up all over former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee.  Sanders, she's trying to get back into the political fray. She's announcing in a video this morning she is running for the governor of Arkansas. That's something former President Trump suggested she do, and she resigned back in twenty nineteen. And Sanders is now emphasizing her experience working with Donald Trump. Wow.  What a big day for former Trump staffers Sarah Huckabee. Sanders is running for governor. Steven Miller found a half eaten mouse.  The future's looking bright, people. But yes, Sarah Huckabee. Sanders says that she's going to be running for governor of Arkansas, which, based on her track record, means she's not going to be running for governor."}]}

Please welcome Jonah Goldberg.  I thought about calling you up sort of a McCrone versus Trump kind of thing and getting all antsy, but I decided we should have done that.  We should have done a little handshake into a kiss into like a little moment into a thing. Yeah. And I could have, like, whispered, I like your musk, which is way I think he was saying to him at one point felt like it felt like a Trump crush really into him, which is something that is good for America.  Yes. Yeah.  Maybe, you know, if it's good for America, for us to get along with, you know, our two hundred year old allies.  That's right.  But if he's only doing it because is sucking up to him less good, right?  I mean, it should be they're getting along because we have mutual interests, we have mutual values and they reflect that. It shouldn't be because the leader of France says not only are you a handsome man, you're a powerful man. Right? I mean, it shouldn't just be sucking up. It should be something more.  I feel like it should just be that. Yeah. Welcome to the show. Great to be here. Thanks. Thank you for coming through.  And you have written quite a book here, Suicide of the West, if ever there there's a title that would catch you. Is that why the title of the book?  Well, in part because I didn't say the death of the West or the decline of the West, as grim as the title sounds and it actually doesn't end.  As grim as it sounds, suicide's a choice choose to do to make these decisions that you're making.  And I think that one of the things that people don't appreciate is that if you you can you can choose not to do them as well.  And then a lot of the things that are are plaguing this country are within our own power to fix. Right.  It's interesting because you talk about nationalism, tribalism, populism, all of these things that you believe are leading to the decline of America.  When you talk about the decline of America, are you specifically referring to capitalism and the way it's made America thrive over the past three hundred years?  In part, I mean, I call this thing the miracle, right? And the miracle isn't just capitalism. It's also natural rights, civil rights, free speech, all of the things that we associate with the Bill of Rights, the idea that the individual sovereign, that we are captains of ourselves, that we are citizens, not subjects, that the government works for us.  We don't work for a government.  These are all unbelievably new ideas in the history of humanity. Humanity split off from the Neanderthals like three hundred thousand years ago. And for most of humanity's existence, we were poor, ignorant, bloody, violent creatures. Right. And and our human nature hasn't changed.  We are still the same creatures we were ten thousand years ago. What has changed are our values, our norms, our institutions. And if you don't have gratitude for them and if you don't try to protect them, they'll go away.  And it's interesting that you say that you go if we if we don't have gratitude for them, if we don't try to protect them, because that seems like an argument many people in America will use for one group or another.  What's interesting in this book is you refer to both sides of the political spectrum doing similar damage to an idea that that may cause damage to that idea in the same way. So, for instance, you write for National Review as a conservative writer, but at the same time, you are not a fan of Trump.  I think that's fair. Right.  So you are saying that populism, both on Trump's side and on the left, there's a danger of that hurting Americans?  That's right.  There's nothing wrong with a little populism, right? There's nothing wrong with a little nationalism. It's like a pinch of salt brings out the flavor in the meal, right. Too much ruins the meal and way too much is literally poisonous. Right. And so all poisons are determined by the dosage. My favorite New Yorker cartoon, which my wife got blown up for me a few years ago and framed, has two dogs drinking martinis at a bar.  And one dog says to the other, you know, it's not good enough that dogs succeed. Cats must also fail.  Right. And that's sort of where we are as a culture right now where it's not.  And this drives me crazy about my own side these days, where I talk to young conservative activists, college students, and I say, look, by all means, fight political correctness, if that's what you want to do. Right.  But just because being rude is politically incorrect doesn't mean being rude is good. And so much of what's happening, I think on both sides of the political aisle is this this idea that you can do almost any horrible thing if it annoys the right people. Right.  And that's a huge part of the defense of Donald Trump, which I just find intellectually bankrupt, which is, well, he's got the right enemies or he's making the right people upset. What you have to look at what what is actually upsetting them. Right.  And some of the things that upset liberals and lefties I can agree with and I'll support. But some of the other things are just sort of crassness rudeness for its own sake. And I don't see why I should defend that just because he's on my team, as it were.  It's interesting that you bring up teams because it does feel like America's. Drifting into a space where politics is solely about teams, you pick your team or whatever your team does, you defend. So the other team, whatever they do, you pick the opposite.  The ref is biased. This is against us. Those are not facts because they don't work in our favor. Does this, in your opinion, lead to a place where the experiments of America begins to decline? Is is that the only thing that's kept it moving or has it just been an illusion that's lasted for three hundred years because there were people who were previously oppressed and that wasn't something that America ever was? No, look.  I mean, look, are there bad things in American history that we need to atone for them to fix or that we have problems today that we need to still work on? Absolutely. My point is, is that, again, human nature has no history. Human nature is a constant.  We have if you took a kid from New Rochelle and you sent them back to a Viking village to be raised by Vikings a thousand years ago, he would end up going pillaging the English countryside. Right. You take a Viking baby and you bring it to New Rochelle.  He's going to grow up to be an orthodontist. Right.  And a very big orphan. Yeah. And so these challenges exist in every generation. It is human nature to want to be part of your tribe.  We are hardwired to be part of a group. That's how we evolve, is to say I will do everything to help in Darwin writes about this. I will do everything to help my team, my friends, my kin, my family, my allies, my coalition.  And the stranger is the enemy. Right.  And what you know, and so people you know, there's a common cliche that says people have to be taught to hate.  No, they actually have to be taught not to hate.  That's what civilizations do is teach people to see.  And it starts with Christianity or Judaism. You go way back in the religion department. But the fundamental insight is that you need to teach people that strangers have human dignity, that strangers are decent people. And just because you don't know them doesn't mean or don't agree with them. It doesn't make them the enemy. And I think we're falling down on that in our politics and our education.  And instead we're telling people, just go with your feelings. Your rage is more important than facts or argument. Right. And that's where you get populism. That's where you get a lot of nationalism, too.  But if you if you have somebody who is trying to end you, how do you then work on responding to that?  Because that's something that I that I'm always trying to figure out in my head is it's one thing for people to say, let's keep politics civil. Let's not have an argument, let's not point each other out as enemies, etc. But there are times when let's say Charlottesville is a good example.  Sure, there are people who are literally saying we are Nazis.  These people are wishing for the end of other human beings. It's a bit difficult at that point to say yes, yes, but let us let us sit with them and engage as they drive over us.  It's a very difficult space to be in.  I agree with you and look like my last name's Goldberg. I'm not really a turn the other cheek guy.  I'm more of a smiting and wrath guy, so I get what you're talking about. But right. But my point is, and I agree with you and tell you about the neo-Nazis.  One of the things that infuriates me about what Steve Bannon and some of the people around Trump did was claim that somehow a bunch of friggin Nazis were part of our coalition. And I would keep trying to explain to these people, no, you and they literally say that they want to get rid of people like me, people like you.  Why? Why should I for a common group with them just to get this guy elected or just for political purposes, whatever?  Some things are existential questions. And I'm not saying that we should have gone into Charlottesville and shot a bunch of Nazis. Right.  But the idea that somehow they have something important to say, though, I need to find common ground with them, I I think is ridiculous. Right.  I also think it's ridiculous to call people who aren't Nazis, Nazis as a way to demonize them.  And I think there's a lot of that that's going on, too. And so it's a prudential question and you have to sort of figure it out as you go. It doesn't mean you can't have big arguments. I've always believed that democracy is about disagreement, not about agreement. It's about having arguments. What I don't like about our politics right now is how people don't think arguments matter at all, that facts don't matter, that, you know, the whole point of the Enlightenment was this idea that you could persuade people.  Right.  And part of the reason I wrote this book is it's much a cautionary tale to my allies. On the right is that a lot of people are just giving up on persuasion and instead it's just hammer and tongs. Cats must fail.  It's all about power.  The arguments in defense of Donald Trump in the in twenty sixteen, we're all about winning and strength, winning and strength or not. They're absolutely a concepts. Winning for what? Strength. For what. Unity. For what it has to be the ideas that underlie it.  And we're in a moment where a lot of people just don't care about ideas anymore.  One of the big ideas that you share in the book is that America needs to focus on less identity politics on both sides and more on merits, because merit's is how capitalism thrives is what moves the society forward.  When you say that, though, do you think sometimes a statement like that ignores the fact that some people's merit is overlooked because of identity politics?  Yeah, look, look, you know, it's funny. Like most of the liberals I talked to, they like the words. They agree with me on the populism and nationalism. And they don't like the and the tribalism. They don't like the identity politics. Right. Right.  I am not saying that you can't all I'm not saying that there isn't discrimination out there. Obviously there is. What I'm saying is that one of the great and glorious things and Barack Obama was very eloquent about this, about this country is is not that America were the founding fathers were hypocrites when they started this country.  They were you know, slavery was a big you know, the big you know, what about that? Right. Right. Great description. What about that?  But you know what I'm getting at, right.  So what happens is then Abraham Lincoln comes along with the Gettysburg Address and he redefines what this country is about, about equality.  And then Martin Luther King says, hey, wait a second. One hundred years later says, wait a second. The Founding Fathers wrote a promissory note to the American people that all men, including black men, are created equal.  It's the unfolding of that story, right? That that is what matters.  And so one of the core values, all of civilization is, is the story we tell ourselves about ourselves.  And one of the reasons why Martin Luther King was so persuasive is he was appealing to the best ideals of white America and saying you should take people as you find them. One of the great things about the American founding, which doesn't get taught anymore, is that we got rid of titles of nobility.  We got rid of of the notion that simply by an accident of birth, one person is better than another person.  And so a little identity politics, just like a little nationalism in terms of ethnic pride and solidary.  All of that is fine when you start reducing whole categories of people to an abstraction and say, all I need to know about you is the color of your skin.  Right. That's when you get into a problem.  And this idea that all white people are racist is is, first of all, not true. You know, intermarriage rates between white and blacks are going through the roof. They can't all be racists. Right.  But but I think the argument is less all white people are racist and the system has been created by white people to oppress people of color. So I think when when people say why people are racist, I think that's disingenuous. But most of the time, the argument people are saying is, hey, we can admit that the system from the founding fathers through to redlining, through segregation was written in such a way that it would benefit one race over another.  It would it would hamper the cats and allow the dogs to succeed.  And look and I think there's obviously a lot of truth to that. At the same time, the definition of what counts as white changed over time. You the Benjamin Franklin changed for everyone except black people. But it's true that and that's true, too.  And that's my that's part of my point, is that it is an outrage that this country took so long to include everybody in this idea of universal equality.  That is not an argument for getting rid of the value of universal equality. Right. Right. It is.  It is to say that we need to be more consistent in applying these ideals rather than saying these ideals themselves are bankrupt, because it is these ideals that for all of human history, the average human being everywhere on Earth lived on average of three dollars a day, Africa, Asia, Europe, everywhere.  And then once and only once in all of human history, it starts to go like this. And it's because these ideas start getting put into action. I think we should be.  We live in this moment of the greatest alleviation of material poverty in all of human history. Hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa coming out of poverty."}]}

Today is February twenty second, which means it's the last week of Black History Month, which is why I've decided now is the perfect time to make some new black history by being the first black man to ski down Mount Everest.  I tripped getting into my UBA anyway.  On tonight's show, it's raining plain parts in Colorado. Michael Costa proves that election fraud is real and why everything is bigger in Texas, including the electricity bills. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah is a. Let's kick things off with some travel news if you're one of those people who can't wait to fly on an airplane again. Well, first of all, congratulations on being basic. And second, you may be willing to wait just a little longer after seeing this.  This morning, the FAA and Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau grounding all Boeing triple sevens with a specific Pratt and Whitney engine as the NTSB investigates how this triple seven engine fell apart in midair just after takeoff.  Two hundred and thirty one passengers aboard United three. Twenty eight from Denver to Honolulu Saturday. That terrifying sight right outside their windows overnight. The NTSB saying two fan blades on the engine were fractured. You can see a broken fan blade in this image on the ground, massive pieces of metal falling onto neighborhoods, some running away, trying to avoid getting hit by pieces falling out of the sky.  I swear on my head, this giant piece falling on Kirby Clements lawn, crushing his truck, looked out the window.  I go, oh, no, that's the front end of an airplane. God damn.  A giant piece of an airplane landing in your front yard. That's terrifying. I mean, on the other hand, how great is it to get something complimentary from an airline? For once, customer service is back.  And as terrifying as this moment was, what's really impressive is that someone was on a plane, so the engine was on fire and the first impulse to take out their phone and record it.  That's how addictive it is to go viral. Every single one of us will spend our last moments of life chasing tweets.  I'm going down, but all my legs are going up. But at the same time, you're also on a plane. So, I mean, there's there's really no other good way to spend your last few minutes on Earth. Oh, God.  The plane is going down. The plane is going down. Let me just load. Crude's too.  Seriously, though, it is hard to overstate how terrible this was. I mean, yet nobody got hurt, but the plane was headed to Honolulu and instead it had to land in Denver. Tell me that that's not a tragedy. Oh, and just by the way, it turns out that this wasn't even the only Boeing accident this week.  Yeah. At this point, Boeing has such a terrible record that people won't even wait for something to go wrong before they say goodbye to their loved ones. Hey, man, I just want to say that I love you and I'm grateful that you were my friend. Dude, what happened?  Do you find out you have cancer?  No, I just booked a flight on a Boeing. No.  But let's move on now to the coronavirus pandemic. It's the reason all your sex dreams are now just about going out bowling.  There's no question that things in the US are moving in the right direction. More people are getting the vaccine, fewer people are getting infected. And our meshuggeneh is finally starting to clear up. But at the same time, things are still very bad. And today, the country reached a grim milestone to remind all of us of that the coronavirus and the pandemics once unthinkable toll in the US.  More than five hundred thousand lives lost in less than one year.  The first reported fatality came on February twenty nine. Three months later, it was one hundred thousand dead.  And then by mid-September, the death toll climbed to two hundred thousand and surpassed three hundred thousand by mid-December.  But then came the deadliest period in the pandemic. Four hundred thousand deaths on January 19th. And now, just one month later, here we are, half a million covid deaths in this country.  President Biden will mark the milestone at the White House with a moment of silence and a candle lighting ceremony.  That's right, people. Five hundred thousand covid deaths, a number that nobody wanted to see. And as painful as that is, you have to admit, you have to admit it is nice to see America's president actually take a moment, just a moment to recognize the toll that coronavirus has taken. I mean, the only time the previous president showed any sadness was when he accidentally deleted FOX News off of his DVR.  What a day for Americans was that day. My sweet Hannity is gone.  The good news is that the number of new infections has plummeted in the last few weeks.  But what's interesting is the number that they've plummeted to is where they were last July, which at the time everyone thought was so horrifying that the country immediately started locking down again. And this just goes to show you that your perspective can change based on where you're coming from. That's it's like if I go to tech right now by a wolf, I'd probably be like, this is the worst day of my life.  But if I went from being attacked by four wolves to one wolf, I'd probably be like, oh, what a relaxing way to start the week.  So, look, this is why it's so important to get people vaccinated as quickly as possible.  And don't give me any excuses about how you're too busy or it's not convenient. Last weekend, a 19 year old Seattle woman walked six miles in the snow to keep her appointment because the roads hadn't been plowed, which is incredible, although if you believe old people's stories, walking miles in the snow is what they do all the time. They love that shit. But still, if a 90 year old woman can do it, you can do it, too.  And don't tell me. But I'm not 90 years old. I'm too young to get the vaccine right now. That's also no excuse for a strange story now showing the lengths to Florida women we're willing to go to to get the vaccine. And they are caught dressing as grannies just so they can get the shot. Now, here's the thing. It worked for them the first time around. Officials say the women are thirty four and forty four years old.  So you can see one of the more a bonnet and a long cardigan. The other didn't make much of an effort to cover up a vaccinator. Thought they looked funny. So they were stopped before getting their shots, and that's when they found out both women had faked their birth dates. Now officials want to know how they were able to get away with getting the first shot. The women are not facing any charges, but police did yell at them, calling their actions selfish.  OK, this is outrageous. You call that dressing up as a granny. All that woman did was put a bandage on and that other one didn't do anything, put on a wig, hunched over or even easier. Just download the Facebook app on your phone. I mean, if you got that, you're seventy five minimum. If you want to cheat your way to the vaccine, you at least have to put in the work. No one would have bought the charade.  I'm pretty sure Mrs. Doubtfire wouldn't have gotten the kids back if he just showed up like, Hey, it's me, Mrs. Doubtfire, I'm your nanny.  How did they even think that they could pretend to be old women at that age? I mean, personally, I blame porn, you know, they start putting women in the category of twenty six. Of course we have unrealistic ideas of what grannies look like, but what's crazy is they would have gotten away with it if the doctors hadn't gotten suspicious. Hey, wait a minute. If you're a grandma, how come you haven't tried to set me up with one of your grandkids yet?  But let's move on now to our main story, the ongoing crisis in Texas. A week after the state was battered by winter storms that took out the power grid, nearly nine million people still don't have clean water. But don't worry, help is on the way after getting blasted for flying to Cancun when his own heat went off.  Ted Cruz, Texas senator and Disney princess before True Love's kiss is now back in his home states doing the literal bare minimum for the sake of the cameras.  Ted Cruz appearing back in front of the cameras. He spent the weekend helping Houston residents and first responders who served barbecue to firefighters and police officers, also delivered safe drinking water to folks who need it. Sorry, Cruz, this is not going to cut it, my man. Men see this right here. This is the politician version of coming home with flowers the day after Valentine's Day is not nothing, but your ass is still sleeping on the couch. And honestly, I don't know why politicians try to pull off these lame photo ops.  They basically just turn people who actually need real help into political props and their photographers probably just make it worse. Yes. Yes, that's fabulous. Yes, yes, yes. Pottermore, Pottermore. Like, you don't have any food or water, but I don't have any food or water. Great use that. Use that. Yes, Fenice.  Now, fortunately, most Texans do have their electricity back on now so they can finally log on to all those meetings that really should have just been emails. But even some people who didn't lose their power are finding out that they weren't as lucky as they first thought. The desperation growing in Texas. Temperatures are finally rising, but so is outrage over absurdly high electric bills.  Texans like Scott Willoughby, who signed up for gritty energy, not knowing his rate could vary with the market. So when power supply went down from the storm, his typically two hundred dollar bill took off.  What was the damage? Sixteen thousand seven hundred ninety eight dollars, something like that. And this was not a bill. This was withdrawn. This was withdrawn straight from my account in Fort Worth.  The utility company charged Ty Williams seventeen thousand dollars.  So we were held hostage really with our our rate that we were working with is really crazy.  I'm trying to get gas and groceries and make sure that my pipeline explodes. The last thing that I'm thinking about is a seven thousand dollar bill from my utility.  Wow. People. Seventeen thousand dollars for electricity. At that point, it's cheaper to literally burn your own money for warmth. That's probably one Amish guy on the street right now. All smug as hell seeing the story. He's eating a homemade stick of butter like I told them. So, bitches. Because seriously, people at seventeen thousand dollars, it's almost not worth having any electricity. I mean, at the very least, you're going to have to make extremely tough choices.  Do you charge grandma's oxygen machine or your PlayStation controller? Because, I mean, grandma needs the oxygen to live, but you can't just stop playing Assassin's Creed, Valhalla before you unite in England.  And I think grandma would have understood that. But the question is, why are some Texans being hit with bills bigger than their belt buckles? Well, unlike every other state, it turns out Texas has very few regulations on its utility companies.  And this free market system used to be the pride of Texas. In fact, a couple of years ago, Ted Cruz was bragging that the success of Texas energy was built over many years on free enterprise and low regulation. But now now that Texans are being charged twenty thousand dollars to toast a bagel. Cruz has discovered that regulation might not be so bad.  Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz tweeting, This is wrong. No power company should get a windfall because of a natural disaster. And Texans should not get hammered by ridiculous rate increases for last week's energy debacle. State and local regulators should act swiftly to prevent this injustice.  All you tell him, Ted Cruz, the only Texan that should be getting hammered, is me at the hotel bar in Cancun.  So, yes, Ted Cruz has reversed his stance on regulation like it was a flight path to Mexico.  And I mean, let's be honest, nobody forced these Texans to choose the world's shadiest company for their electricity. But also nobody really talked about the worst case scenario when they touted the wonders of an unregulated markets. When conservatives talk about freedom from governments, they only focus on the good things. But that's not the whole picture. If you were running a zoo and you told all the antelopes, congrats, guys, we're giving you all the freedom to roam around the zoo, that's good news.  But it would be only fair to tell them that the lions are also going to be getting that freedom because that shit is not as good for the antelopes as you make it sound. All right. When we come back, Michael Costa shows us how humans aren't the only species with election fraud scandals around.  We think America finally ready for this, a show by black people. For all people about the black experience in America, it's time to go there. Coming Tuesday night on ABC, Soul of a Nation, all the pain, all the joy, unafraid, funny, beautiful.  And there will be news coming to ABC Tuesday night at 10:00. Nonsense. So some of this is coming and I hope you'll watch Soul of a Nation. I'll be watching The Daily Show, Eres Edition.  And the following message is brought to you by American Express, and they're built to last podcast that highlights the story's history and continued legacy of black owned small businesses that shape American culture.

It looks like we're on track to have the highest voter turnout in terms of percentage of the electorate since the turn of the century, not this century. Last one.  Nineteen hundred damn the highest turnout since nineteen hundred, although it's a little different because back in nineteen hundred, most of the electorate was horses and not even female horses either. Only male horses who owned land very different time. Also back then, people had more time to vote when they could just switch shifts with their kids. Thank you so much for covering my ass to me. I owe you a pint of Guinness for that. But today I'm only seven years old.  Right? Straight whiskey. Molad, what was I thinking? Although when you think about it, it makes sense that turnout this year is close to nineteen hundred because I mean, thanks to Korona, life is a lot like nineteen hundred. You know, we're home a lot. Life is slow paced. We're baking our own bread. The only difference is we have Netflix and back then they only had Hulu.  I can't wait to watch that had made today. I heard Kerans in this episode.  Now of course the presidential race was the main thing, bringing people to the polls and then after that, the Senate and congressional races.  But all across the country, people were also approaching voters on street corners and saying, yo, you want to vote on this drug ballot initiative.  Also on the ballot in five states, legalization of marijuana, four states, Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and New Jersey, all voting to allow recreational marijuana use, while Mississippi voting to allow the use of medical marijuana.  Voters in D.C. passed a measure dropping magic mushrooms to quote, the lowest level of law enforcement priority and a first in the nation.  In Oregon, voters deciding there to decriminalize possession of small amounts of all drugs, including heroin, cocaine and meth. Those found in possession will now have the option to pay a fine or go to a free recovery center.  Damn, you see, Oregon did it right there, the only state with a backup plan in case Biden loses. Honestly, though, I think this is a good thing because way too many people get locked up in America for way too long. Although let's be real, we have a proposal. This will definitely have a little heroin, cocaine and meth on them at the same time. Right now, personally, I don't want to get high in Mississippi because that's one of those states where you need your wits about you.  But I am excited for New Jersey to have we'd imagine how next level edibles are going to be when Italian Americans are running dispensaries. Yeah, so listen in the pepperoni calzone. Yeah, I like it. What a side of OG Kush marinara sauce. You want some of this?  Oh, and if you were looking for some more good news that came out of the election, well, you're in luck because just check out some of the new people who are going to be starting work next year.  Last night's election marked a number of notable wins in first on both sides of the political aisle. So first, you've got Richie Torez and Monder Jones, both from New York, will become the first openly gay black members of Congress when they join the House in January, they will join nine other openly LGBTQ members of Congress. Jones calling the accomplishment a lot of responsibility. Then you've got Sarah McBride, who made history back in twenty sixteen as the first openly transgender person to speak at a major party convention.  She made history again as she was elected to the Delaware state legislator, becoming the highest ranking a trans lawmaker in the country. McBryde celebrated last night, saying in a statement that she is humbled by the support that she's received and she hopes her win, quote, shows an LGBTQ kid that our democracy is big enough for them to.  Oh, yeah, we got transgender people. We got gay people of color. What America's legislatures are on their way from turning from Mad Men into pose. And it's so inspiring that after so many years, the LGBTQ community will finally have an opportunity to get their legislation blocked by Mitch McConnell. And having the first two openly gay black members of Congress is amazing. I mean, except for all the straight members are always going to be trying to set them up together.  So, you know, who else is gay and black? Oh, and there's one more candidate who's breaking barriers this morning.  The Republican candidate for the state legislature in North Dakota who died from covid-19 in October won his election. Tuesday night's election results in North Dakota, showing the Bismarck area districts going to David, Andol and Dave nearing a district, choosing to representatives, typically, and I'll die due to complications. From covid-19 when he was fifty five in October. Oh, hell no. If you lose to a dead guy, kill yourself, at least make it a tight race.  Seriously, can you imagine losing to a dead guy? Your campaign is literally you just saying, hey, I'm alive. And the voters are like, yeah, well, I don't know. I don't know.  All right. We have to take a quick break, but don't go away, because when we come back, we'll be talking about the surprisingly high Hispanic votes for Donald Trump with Professor Heraldo C\u00f3rdova.

We talked about yesterday's surprising Hispanic vote and how both parties can reach Hispanic voters.  Heraldo C\u00f3rdova, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you so much. It's great to be here, Trevor.  You are. I'm going to read this to get it right. You're an associate professor of history and Latin studies at Northwestern University. You most recently wrote a book entitled The Hispanic Republic and the Shaping of an American Political Identity. From Nixon to Trump. It seems like a paradox on the surface. What do you think it is about the Hispanic vote, the Latino vote that a lot of people don't seem to understand where to begin?  I mean, it seems like Americans rediscover Latinos every four years at election time. And I think this year it's especially pronounced because Latinos seem to have moved towards this president that has, at least on the face of things, spent four years abusing us. The truth is, Latinos have voted for the Republican candidate in every election since nineteen seventy two when Richard Nixon won re-election at a rate of about twenty five to thirty three percent, sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more.  So you could say that there's a half century tradition by this point of a significant minority of Latinos voting for Republicans.  One conversation that has always stuck with me was when I was at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland right before the twenty sixteen election, and there was a Mexican woman in the street and she was waving a Trump flag. And I was genuinely, genuinely curious. And I walked up to and I said, hey, how can you support Trump? And she said, because he is working for me. And she said he's building a wall to stop illegal Mexicans from coming over.  And she said, my family's waiting in line. My people are trying to do things the right way, and he's trying to make us the witness instead of them. And I that that shook my perspective because up until that point, American media had always told me the story of Latinos as a monolith. This was the first time when I came to realize that maybe, just maybe, these are all human beings who have different political perspectives.  What a shocking realization. I mean, it's amazing. And so, you know, there is no such thing as the Latino vote, but there are truly millions of Latinos who do vote and it's therefore important to understand their political behavior. I don't think the Republican Party has given up on recruiting Latino immigrants as well. I talked to the chairman of the Republican Party in El Paso who told me that he personally shows up at every naturalization ceremony in El Paso to try to hand out like literature, describing what the Republican Party stands for in the United States.  You can also look at the Latino evangelical church that is in many ways an immigrant religion. Latin American immigrants are evangelical in their home countries, come start churches here and belong to churches here. So it's truly a much more diverse lot than you would think. It feels like in many ways.  The Republican approach has really been focused, though, because on on the Democrat side, I find that there's a lot of in-fighting about how to handle the message. An interesting thing that I heard was from the Democratic winner in Arizona writes the congressional winner in Arizona, who was asked, just asked, hey, what do you think Democrats could do to do better with the with the Latino vote? And he said, well, first of all, stop calling them leathernecks.  And that was an interesting, interesting one for me, because I know that that's been a fight, is people saying, like, I'm not Latin ex. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm I'm Dominican, I'm Cuban, I'm Mexican. I am. Don't call me this thing. Do you think that there's a disconnect sometimes between the academic approach that Democrats take to to in referring to a group versus how the groups just refer to themselves in the streets? That's really interesting.  I mean, I hadn't thought about it in exactly those terms. But I do think that Democrats often fight over identity politics in some ways more than Republicans do. So, you know, remarkably, I think the Republican strategy for recruiting Latinos has been remarkably consistent since the Reagan years in 1980. And it's kind of really relied on identifying what these might be misunderstandings. But they've nevertheless stuck with this kind of core set of issues like family values, of work ethic, patriotism.  And Reagan defined those things. And in many ways, Trump is just running the same playbook that Republicans have run for the past four years. I think you're right. It's a kind of rejection of identity politics and saying that you're Mexican Americans or Cuban Americans are Americans. Instead, you're Americans of Mexican descent. Interestingly, when I was interviewing a Latino Republican leader, he rejected the whole idea of Hispanic Republican. He wanted me to call him a Republican of Hispanic descent instead.  Interesting. It's funny that you say that because I find that Republicans do a much better job of coding their identity politics, I don't agree with the notion that Republicans don't engage in as much identity politics as Democrats. I think Democrats are too blatant about it. So Democrats will say we've got to get black voters and the black vote and the Hispanic vote and we've got to get these gay people to come and help us. And do you know what I mean?  Whereas Republicans go, we've got to protect our farmers. We've got to do a better job of protecting that factory worker in Ohio. We've got to protect him.  You know who he is. And it's a very interesting technique that they use that implies a certain connotation of a person, but it doesn't make that person feel like they're reduced to only the color of their skin. Do you think that could be part of the reason that Republicans do so well?  Oh, man, I wish I got to talk to you every day about this stuff. I mean, that's absolutely right, man. If I hear one more time about, like, the dairy farmer of Wisconsin or the auto worker in Detroit, never mind the fact that there are many, many Latinos who work as dairy farmers or work in auto plants. I mean, but I do think, yes, these are all kind of coded appeals and they do very much suggest a Republican version of identity politics, even if we don't recognize it as such.  I've been coming to the United States, I don't know, on and off for, let's say, a decade. I've lived here for five years now. One thing that's always surprise me is people say, man, as the Hispanic vote grows, the Republican Party is going to be under water. But the one thing I've always asked people, and maybe you're the perfect person to ask is this. Is there not an assumption that may be incorrect, that Hispanic or Latino voters will naturally progressed towards the Democratic Party because they identify in that way, as opposed to understanding that some people can sort of migrate to the space of being white?  If that makes sense? And I say this because I come from a country where we had many classes of people where they said, hey, if you work the right way and if you act the right way, we'll give you white classifications and some of the privileges that white people get. Do you think that that's a possibility going forward? For sure?  That kind of. We also know that one of the many ways that Latinos are diverse is their skin color, even more racially diverse than the class background. And there are all kinds of things. So, yeah, that's certainly part of it. You know, I think there are so many problems with the idea that demography is destiny and demographic change is going to naturally lead to more Democratic victories. I mean, the first, obviously, is that Latinos are politically diverse and feel different ways about a lot of different things.  But the second thing is that it kind of takes for granted that the Republican Party is just going to be static and roll over and play dead as this sea of demographic change washes over them. And I think one of the particularly surprising things about the results from last night is that Donald Trump truly made inroads among Latino voters. And that's shocking to the idea that Donald Trump would be the second coming of someone like George W. Bush to expand the Latino vote.  It just kind of blows the mind. Right. But the fact is he did and he expanded Latino support. And if I were a Democrat today, I wouldn't kind of rest comfortably on this idea that Latinos may be helped by it and win in Arizona and Nevada.  I would be really worried that Trump trumps Latino support seems to have expanded by several points. And that's something we need to spend a lot of time thinking about and questioning a lot of our assumptions.  Well, I will say talking to you is one of the most fascinating conversations I've had. I hope to have you on the show again, and I genuinely recommend that everyone read your book. Thank you so much for taking the time. Take care. Bye bye.  Be sure to check out Harold's great book, The Hispanic Republican The Shaping of an American Political Identity From Nixon to Trump."}]}

Now, my dad talks to me, but not in the way humans do. She uses body language to word how she's feeling. That's why I hate to see her with low energy or excessively scratching. So to make sure my dog is feeling well. I give her fresh factors from springtime natural supplements. She's older and age, but with fresh factors. She still has that puppy spirit. If you love your dog, listen to them with fresh factors.  My dog only tells me good things like running, jumping and wagging her tail. Right, Sandy, go to springtime dotcom to receive free shipping and learn how you can save up to 50 percent. Once we get out of this, once this is all done, we can finally leave the house and do normal things like tongue kiss our Uber drivers. There's going to be one question, one question that people want an answer to more than anything. Where in the hell did this disease come from?  Because before the virus shut down the world, people will happy people will happy to accept the official explanation from China, which was that the virus originated at a live animal market where it's somehow jumped from a bat to a human. And we were like, OK, I think that's the plot of dark night, but we'll accept it.  But now now that all of us have been stuck in the house with nothing to do except throw our cat's birthday parties of a zoo, everyone, everyone at home has had time to come up with some theories about how exactly they think this whole thing went down. Now, I've also been spending a lot of time online, and the most common conspiracy theory I've seen is that the virus jumped from a bat to a human the same way Oriels jumped from packaging into my roommate's mouth.  And with it going, Billy, I see you. And this is a theory many people willing to accept because of racism. People are saying that in China they eat all kinds of crazy things. Hey, I heard they eat cookies with a piece of paper inside. I was also ready to believe this pandemic could have started as a food thing because, look, man, I've been I've been in situations where food starts a thing like I was on a flight once where one person eats a tuna sandwich, but then we all paid the price.  So the story made sense until it came out that those viral videos of people eating that soup weren't even filmed in China. Yeah, and then we found out that viruses can't survive cooking anyway. So that was out the window. Then I heard about a different conspiracy theory. That totally makes sense. You see, it turns out Corona was never just a virus. No, it was actually a weapon created to take old people out.  If you go online, there's no shortage of conspiracy theories. All right. So here's one. The virus was bioengineered in a lab by scientists to be used as a weapon or a form of population control.  This is a theory former politician Bronwyn Bishop has also suggested it is to get rid of non-productive Chinese in the Chinese community, in the words of George Bernard Shaw, who should be eliminated so they don't have to be thieves.  Roseanne Barr is calling the novel coronavirus pandemic a ploy to kill baby boomers.  You know what is normal? I think they're just trying to get rid of all of my generation.  All right. Now, this theory, this theory made complete sense. Who dies the most from the virus? Old people. Who dies the most anyway? Old people, bam. It's the perfect crime. And think about it. As soon as people started saying, OK, Buma, all of a sudden we got coronavirus and old people are dying, there can't be a coincidence. And you might be asking, oh, why would anyone why would anyone want to take out all the old people?  I don't know. Maybe it's because someone was tired of giving up their seat on the bus. Maybe restaurant owners are just tired of having to open for dinner at three p.m. Maybe young people were just tired of getting their ass whipped at Bingol. The point is the motive is there. Now, I will admit, as much as I wanted to believe that theory, I had to let it go, OK? Because a team of scientists, scientists with degrees and qualifications, they sequenced the genome of the coronavirus.  They broke it down and they found that unlike everybody in Miami, this virus definitely wasn't manmade. So, OK, maybe this wasn't a biological weapon designed to destroy the slot machine economy. But that wasn't my favorite theory anyway, because there's one theory, one theory that actually makes the most sense. And it was this there's a conspiracy theory sweeping the globe, that coronavirus is caused by 5G technology.  The theory is that 5G damages the human immune system. All of us should know what's taking place right under our noses.  What 5G action actually does, it absorbs oxygen. And that's really important to know.  5G get switched on. People drop like flies and all of a sudden you've got the excuse because, well, there's a virus going on.  Some people in the UK bought into it so much they started lighting cell phone towers on fire. 5G burning, burning, burning out of control.  Yes. From those cell phone towers, though, we got to put an end to coronavirus and all group chats. I don't know how any of you people, but I did not ask to be a part of this group. Now, I know some of you are sitting at home right now smug, like how does thug cause a virus? That is. But I'll tell you how. Ask yourself this question. What is 5G? It's a superfast network that runs through the air.  You know, what else goes to the core of virus? What else goes through the supermarket? And what burger did I eat while watching the last Superman movie? Five guys, five guys, five G. I rest my case now.  I'm not going to lie.  There are a few coverage gaps in this 5G theory. Just a few. Just a few things that make me doubt. For starters, every part of this theory is completely ridiculous and biologically impossible. Not to mention coronavirus has also exploded in places where they don't even have 5G. So I haven't figured that out yet. And 5G, just like 4G and 3G before it is broadcast at such a low frequency, it's too weak to do any damage to you.  Yeah. So saying 5G makes you sick is sort of like saying an iPhone flashlight gave you a sunburn. In fact, 5G broadcast in the same range as a normal radio. Yeah. And let's be honest, the most dangerous thing we've gotten from a radio wasn't a virus.  It was mumbler number five. And that only killed, what, six thousand people, tops. So when did the coronavirus come from? I don't know. You have said it. I don't know. But I'll tell you this. I don't care if any of these conspiracy theories have been debunked. I'm not taking any chances. From now on, I will no longer be ordering the Papy spicy bat sandwich, even though it's delicious. I also decided I'm not going to get old.  It's just too risky. And most importantly, I've stopped using cell phones, yet no 5G for me from now on, I only use a pager and yeah, no, that makes it harder to send nudes, but I'm going to do my best. And I know the alternative to all of this is that I could just wait for doctors and scientists to figure out where this virus came from. But I mean, come on, man, I'm not crazy.  If you know anything about Kulen, you've probably heard that it's a conspiracy theory, but the truth is it's more like a political cult built around a conspiracy theory and then crossed with a big book of Woodstock puzzles.  And if that sounds complicated, well, wait till you hear what they believe in for believers.  Q is an anonymous government official who post classified information about a covert battle between the president and a malicious ring of celebrities, political elites and the so-called deep state.  This anonymous poster who was giving secret clues about becoming, quote, Great Awakening.  The central theme here is that Hillary Clinton and many of the world's other politicians and celebrities are members of a murderous child sex ring.  Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks and others eat children in order to extract a life extending chemical from their blood group.  They believe that a group of military generals recruited President Trump to break up this conspiracy and end their control of the government and the media.  Donald Trump and the Cuban on view is going to save us from this in a moment called The Storm.  His tweets are misspelled for a reason and when he does campaign. The smoking gun, it's all code for what is this telling us? OK, I want whatever these people are smoking because Trump's typos are a secret message. Man, I wish people would this forgiving when I did stupid shit. No, you guys don't get it. When Trevor threw up at that party, he was showing us it's what's on the inside that counts. But look, this guy's also not wrong.  President Trump's tweets are misspelled for a reason, and that reason is. He can't read. Now, look, if Hillary and Oprah were eating children to live longer, I would be horrified because that is such a waste of magic blood. You feed those kids to Ruth Bader Ginsburg people priorities, but there's no ways this conspiracy theory is actually true. And look, I believe a lot of crazy shit, OK? I believe the TSA confiscates all our lotion in order to secretly sell it back to us at Walgreen's.  I believe possums are just dogs that make I believe no one has actually ever broken up with me. They've just all been abducted by aliens. But this conspiracy theory is crazy, even for conspiracy theories.  I mean, set aside everything else you're telling me Trump is doing something heroic, but instead of taking credit for it, he's keeping it a secret. That is the most unbelievable thing I have ever heard. Plus, if you're wondering how it's possible that Trump can be leading the fight against the paedophile ring when he was friends with Jeffrey Epstein for years as well, according to Q, Trump has been undercover since the 90s, which I believe I mean, if there's one thing Trump is known for, it's his famously long attention span.  So how did this insane theory take off? Well, partly it latched on to fears about the real phenomenon of human trafficking, partly in fear of ancient anti Semitic tropes about elitists who drink the blood of children. But mostly it was just the good old Internets.  Kuhnen first emerged in the months after President Trump took office, starting on fringe Internet message boards before spreading to social media.  The pandemic has only made things worse. And so these people are just there all day. Facebook groups have grown exponentially with Kuhnen.  In just four months, membership of the biggest Public Cuneen groups rose by 700 percent.  We saw a lot of groups who were wellness communities, people who were interested in alternative health. People would the algorithm would sort these people together with the Cuban people. They would say alternative health. Maybe they're into antibiotics. If they're anti vax, maybe they're into Donald Trump. And within one or two clicks, people would go down these very bad paths. Yep.  That's how the shit always goes on the it feels like at this point the entire purpose of Facebook is to funnel everyone towards the craziest conspiracy theories possible because people will join a group about cycling and then five hours later, they're like, Hillary Clinton is a mountain goat people.  She's an actual girl.  And it's not surprising that the pandemic turned out to create the perfect conditions for people to get radicalized. Some people join Kuhnen, some people ordered Pelton's, and nine of them will shut up about it. This also shows you how much the Internet is ruining our brains. When Shakespear was quarantined during the plague, he was like, maybe I should write King Lear. And now people are sitting around during coronavirus going, I wonder if I could prove that Tom Hanks has sex with the devil.  Either way, starting from the swampy parts of the Internet, Kuhnen gradually picked up followers and eventually grew into a major online movement. And it hasn't seemed to matter that many of the things it predicted over the years just never came true.  Early on, they were claiming that Robert Mueller was secretly investigating and not to indict the cabal of Democratic leaders. And then President Trump was secretly working with Mueller's team. President Trump was secretly created a police force, by the way, to arrest them and force them to wear ankle bracelets.  The belief is that somehow the late JFK Jr. is alive and helping Trump clean up the deep state.  Nearly all of these clues, including that Hillary Clinton was arrested, turn out to be wrong. But the batting average doesn't seem to matter.  You can present them with evidence. You can demonstrate how the predictions have gone wrong and they don't seem to care. It's just again and again that Q is bigger than anything that they can be presented. But to the contrary. That's right.  It doesn't matter how many of Kyuss outlandish predictions fail to pan out, it never seems to have an impact on the movement. And that, my friends, is the classic sign of cult behavior. Once you're invested enough in something, you will make any excuse for its failures. So please don't be looking for logic here. That's not how cults work, OK? Cults don't follow logic. They follow whatever the cult tells them. That's why you always see cult leaders go so quickly from the sacred.  Aliens have chosen us to weird news guys. The sacred aliens told me I should bang all of your wives. I guess it must be for our redemption or something to go somewhere I pick her. So thanks to this religious fervor, Kuhnen took over the Internet and it would have been fairly harmless if it had just stayed on the Internet. You know, like Momoh. Nothing was a joke was.  That was weird, but the scary thing about Kuhnen is what happened when A jumped from the screen to the streets.  This is not just a bunch of online crazy talk. It's dangerous in real life.  The FBI says Kuhnen in there. Many conspiracy theories are a potential domestic terrorism threat. The North Carolina man who shot up this D.C. pizza restaurant looking for nonexistent pedophiles believed in similar theories.  On more than one occasion, people believed to be followers of Kuhnen have shown up, sometimes with weapons in places that the character told them were somehow connected to anti Trump conspiracies. In June, a man armed with a rifle and a handgun drove an armored vehicle to the Hoover Dam on what he said was a mission from Kuhnen cutdown.  Followers have allegedly been involved in a foiled presidential assassination plot. The devastating California wildfire, an armed standoff with local law enforcement officers in Arizona in July.  A twenty four year old man was charged in the shooting death of a reputed mob boss. His attorneys argued he was motivated by Kuhnen written on his hand in the courtroom where Kuhnen symbols.  You cannot be serious. Can you imagine being a mob boss and you get whacked by a kid from a message board? Not a rival, just some random kid. You almost want them to line your obituary and say you were a snitch.  But this is insane. KUMALO When people out in the world doing real things, shootings, hijackings, kidnappings, of all the bad advice I've gotten on the Internet, nothing ever came close to making me murder a mob boss. The worst advice I ever got was to use toothpaste to get rid of pimples. But I ate the entire tube of toothpaste. All I got was a tummy ache. Pimples didn't go anywhere. And even with sporadic real world violence, it might be tempting to dismiss Kuhnen as just another lunatic fringe.  But it's actually becoming pretty close to mainstream.  In fact, there are roughly 50 Kuis supporters who ran for office in the Republican Party this year, and it's almost certain that one of them is actually going to be in Congress next year, although maybe that's a good thing."}]}

It's just nothing I have heard about before. And so the moments I strive for in my lifetime, which is to bring poetry into the spaces that we least expect it so that we can fully kind of grapple with the ways in which it can heal and kind of resurrect us.  Let's talk a little bit about poetry. I mean, it feels like poetry, like some art forms has it has its highs and then it has moments where it disappears. Why do you think we should never forget poetry? What is it about poetry that you feel society needs to hold on to?  Well, what I always say is poetry stands as a great reminder of the past that we stand on in the future that we stand for. I do not think it is any coincidence that when America seeks to kind of consecrate its ideals, it does so through poetry. I don't think it's systems that we see a poem at the base of the Statue of Liberty as opposed to like a scientific formula or even a prosaic paragraph. Why is it that we call forth poetry in those moments or even point out to students, when you're at a Black Lives Matter march and you see banners that say they buried us but they didn't know recedes, that's poetry at the racial justice movement.  And so poetry, because it's inherently rebellious in its nature, I think it really becomes the language and the rhetoric of the people we get to kind of co-opt it and play on it. And what's more, we get to use those words to realize our thoughts and transform those thoughts into action.  You have a journey ahead of you that I think nobody can predict, which is exciting. And you've had a journey that has been unpredictable. You you talked about it growing up in a family with a single mom who was raising yourself and your twin sister and your brother as well, and and how you just fought to achieve. My question to you then is what are you aspiring to seeing that you've basically done it all? I mean, in the past few weeks?  That's a great question. I mean, I'm really taking that time to kind of sit back and think and be like, well, wow, that was it. Kind of what's next? And for me, I don't think it's about kind of beating my last thing or even competing against myself. I hear that a lot. And that's fine for other people. I'm not necessarily fighting against myself or competing or contesting against anything I've done, but I want to keep on the trajectory that I've started for myself.  I never want to kind of dally or diverge from that. And for me, that just means using my poetry to touch and heal and impact as many people as possible. And that can be at the inauguration and the Super Bowl. It can be in a living room. It's often in classrooms and other students. And so that's what's next for me on the more like resum\u00e9 tick thing that I always have to mention when I'm on talk shows and like, I have three books coming out.  So there's also what I need to write. But, you know, I'm just chugging forward.  I know everyone's going to be reading the books. Thank you so much, Amanda Goodman, and congratulations on all your success.  Thank you so much. Don't forget Amanda's books, The Hill We Climb Changed Things and her poetry collection are all available to preorder right now. All right. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this.  Lancaster, South Carolina, is in the middle of not much, but growing up nearby. I knew it as the hometown of a black man named Jim Duncan, who became a Super Bowl hero after the 15th. Now, my new podcasts return man. I'll discover that his death still makes no sense at all.  The story was that my brother went to the police station, took a gun off a police officer and shot himself in the head. Most people don't believe that. For the past three years at the Rockville Herald, I looked back at a story that's timelier than ever breaking down. So have you got some time to talk?  It involves race, the mental state of the person and a child that was scared to death to say anything. Listen to return man on the I Heart radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast.

President Joseph pours a Biden over the weekend, Biden took a short break from his day to day president to catch the Super Bowl from his home in Delaware. And if you aren't immediately outraged about that, well, you obviously haven't been watching the last forty eight hours of conservative news media.  Joe Biden is planning to travel across state lines to watch the Super Bowl, despite calls from the CDC not to travel. Biden and his wife, Jill, are going to spend the weekend at their Delaware home. Now, this just a few days after the CDC warned Americans against traveling this weekend, stressing it could increase their chances of spreading the coronavirus.  What happened to the suggestion that you shouldn't travel during this covid epidemic?  He's setting a horrible example and he's not practicing what he preaches in any shape, form or fashion. And if he really thinks that going out and traveling at this particular point in time is putting people at risk, then he's doing exactly that. He's putting thousands and thousands of people at risk by doing this. It's very hypocritical.  Why does he need to go? What's wrong with the White House? What's wrong with spending the weekend in the white?  I guess on believable? You are setting a horrible example, Joe. If you go to your home in Delaware soon, everyone will go to your home in Delaware and then they'll expect snacks. Joe, and what are you going to do, buy tortilla chips for three hundred million people? There's no way the store has that many. So you're going to have to get those quinoa chips. And I know they're better for you, but they taste like cardboard, Joe.  And don't tell me all but Trevor isn't that different because he's the president and he's flying on Air Force One. No. What if I fly on Air Force One right off to Joe Biden, huh? Coronavirus can linger for hours, people. And I also know that people are saying, oh, come on, why are you criticizing Biden for traveling during the pandemic when Donald Trump spent every weekend golfing and coughing on the buffet table and hosting rallies at the same time?  But that's not the same. Donald Trump wasn't being a hypocrite because he wanted people to dive covid. But it's not surprising that Biden bent the travel rules for himself because he's been president for less than three weeks. And already he's had more scandals than we can keep track of. Although, my friends, we are going to try and our brand new segment, Joe Biden, the worst president in history that we can remember.  There are two things that are unforgivable for any American politicians releasing the aliens from area fifty one and insulting the troops.  And last week, Biden's press secretary launched a gratuitous attack on the newest and bravest troops of all.  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki facing criticism for mocking the space force, whether the president has made a decision on keeping or keeping the scope of space force.  Wow, Space Force. It is an interesting question. I am happy to check with our space for a point of contact. And I assure you that is I will find out and see if we have any update on that. Well, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee is now calling that comment disgraceful. And he's asking the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, to apologize. She's literally, openly mocking the branch of military that was actually enacted by Congress with Democratic support.  There's some arrogance there. There's a little condescension as well. One hundred years from now, the Space Force will be one of the important parts of our military.  This is no joke. How dare you? Jen Psaki, Space Force is an illustrious branch of the military that was formed an entire year ago because Donald Trump had a weird sex dream about herself.  If you're going to mock Spaceballs, maybe, maybe you should mock all the people who were cut in half when Neptun stole Saturn's rings and threw them at Earth.  A weight that never happened because space for saved us space is no joke, OK, this isn't funny. America is sending troops to space where they have to poop in a little bag. You think that's funny? And if the bag is to fool the poop escapes and have to chase the floating poop around the spaceship, does that sound funny to you guys? A bunch of guys in fancy uniforms floating around the room trying to grab a poop, and then the boss opens the door and he says, what's going on?  Then the poop goes in his mouth. Is that a joke to you? You think any of this shit is funny, huh? Now, insulting the military is bad enough. But before the space for scandal had even died down, Joe Biden took things a step further, this time attacking the honor and decency of our heroes in law enforcement.  There is some controversy over comments that the new president made about these about FBI agents as a generality. He made these comments and it's getting a lot of reaction.  Listen, by and large, the vast, vast majority of these men and women are decent, honorable people.  What should be taken away from that for him to, say the vast majority of men and women are decent, honorable people.  Why suddenly the qualifiers on the arbitration of who's a good guy and who's a bad guy?  What percentage of people are we talking? Or 80 percent good and decent people at the FBI? 90. Can you be more specific?  Yeah. Joe Biden, be more specific. Is it ninety nine percent or is it just one bad guy, huh? Is it Doug? It's totally Doug, isn't it. I knew it. You know, he cheats on Margaret, right?  Like what have you heard? But this is just reprehensible. How dare you say that the vast, vast majority of FBI agents are honorable when clearly it is the vast, vast, vast majority. I mean, if you care about those agents at all, you would have thrown in a third bust. And I especially understand why this must have been a shock for the folks over at Fox News to hear a president slander the brave members of the corrupt deep state like that.  I just hope the decent, honorable scumbags like James Comey don't hear about this. Now, look, it's not surprising that Joe Biden is bringing scandal to the White House.  I mean, after all, his entire campaign was little more than just a front to launder money for his son, Hunter Biden. And just as everyone predicted, Hunter is already turning daddy's presidency into his own personal piggy bank.  So Hunter Biden has a new book that is set to come out within his father's first hundred days. But critics are pointing out President Biden said his family wasn't going to do this. They weren't going to cash in on his presidency. Do you write a book for free?  The real concern here, though, is Simon and Schuster is is is the is the company that canceled Josh Holly in his book, but they're doing the book for Hunter Biden.  How will this book be used? Will will it be a kind of test of loyalty to Joe Biden to buy the book? Will it be Marseille's?  Yes, my friends, welcome to Joe Biden's America, where if you want to covid vaccine, you'll have to pass a pop quiz on Hunta Biden's book. What important lesson can Hunter Biden learn in Chapter nine to believe in himself? Wrong. Give him covid. And what if you're not getting the vaccine? Biden will still know if you bought the book. You know why? Because our bookshelves in the background of all our zoo meetings, did Joe Biden engineer the coronavirus just to make sure we all bought his son's book?  I'm just asking questions. But yes, that's what happened. This is what we're facing people scandal after scandal after scandal. The unfortunate truth is that Joe Biden is incapable of doing literally anything right as president. In fact, even before his first day in office was finished, Biden had racked up three major scandals.  Joe Biden made fighting the coronavirus pandemic the main staple of his campaign. However, many have noticed that Biden and other high level officials at his own inauguration were failing to socially distance. Even wearing their masks was at times optional or not correct the way they were doing it when they were within six feet of others. Look, there was a lot of hugging going on, and these are not necessarily people who shared bubbles. Joe Biden hired private security as if he were not satisfied with the National Guard and the military.  He wanted even more guns at his behest.  Joe Biden jumped the gun a little bit today. He got sworn in at ten minutes to noon. I don't mean to nit pick, but he does say noon, according to the law.  That's right. Joe Biden stole ten minutes of Donald Trump's presidency. Watch. Fox News calls it 10 Ghazi. Who knows what Trump could have accomplished in those ten minutes? I mean, maybe that's when he was finally going to release his health care plan. He could have used that time to walk down half a ramp. And do you have any idea how much Fox News Trump could have watched in that ten minutes?  Like ten minutes. So those are the many Joe Biden scandals exposed by the muckraking journalists of conservative media in just his first three weeks in office. And who knows, by this time tomorrow, we could find out that Biden left the toilet seat up or even worse, spoiled the end of joy division.  The Super Bowl, it's the world championship of a sport only played in America, and yesterday's game was one for the record books this morning, Tom Brady is running out of fingers for his rings, capturing his record seventh Super Bowl at age 43.  I think we knew this was going to happen. I didn't win. The Bucks didn't just win. They tripled last year's champs, the Kansas City Chiefs. Thirty one to nine the weekend also electrifying on stage, singing some of his biggest hits in a slickly produced halftime show. Using mass dancers to keep things covid friendly, how, yeah, what a great halftime show and it looks like the weekend finally found a use for that toilet paper has been haunting.  And how about Tom Brady winning his seventh Super Bowl ring? At this rate, he's going to be the first player with a Super Bowl to ring people. I mean, at this point, Tom Brady has led the kind of life that eight year olds narrates to themselves in the backyard.  The crowd goes when Tommy wins in seven Super Bowl. And now he's rich and he's married to a supermodel and now he's riding a dinosaur. Rah rah.  And look, I know a lot of people don't like Tom Brady. Anyway, let's move on now from the Super Bowl to the big game in Washington. Tomorrow, the US Senate will begin its annual impeachment trial of Donald Trump, and there's three possible outcomes. He could be convicted, he could be exonerated or the most likely one. He could commit new crimes during the trial that he'll get impeached for next year. But whatever happens to Trump, hundreds of his followers already facing consequences for rioting at the capital, although at least one of them is getting a chance to cut loose before she might get locked up.  A woman accused of participating in the deadly capital riot will get to go on vacation later this month.  A judge in Washington, D.C., granted Jenny Cuds request to travel to Mexico. The motion was granted and filed yesterday. Cuds lawyers say she had a prepaid weekend retreat for herself and her employees at Becky's Flowers to go to Riviera Maya, Mexico. The retreat would reportedly serve as a work related bonding time for employees and their spouses all year insurrectionary Club Med Kozmo.  Honestly, if I were this woman's employee, I'd be a little nervous to go on a bonding retreat. I mean, these aren't the kind of people I'm putting on a blindfold and going on a trust hike with. OK, I'm sticking my hands out. All right. Closing them, like you said. Wait, how long am and what am I do? Am I strangling Nancy Pelosi? I'm not cool. Jenny, what I love about this is that this woman planned the vacation before she participated in the riots.  So in her head, she was going to go to Washington, overthrow the government, and then what, hit the beach for two weeks? I'm like, how serious of a revolution were you planning, lady? These riots were all shouting that it's seventeen seventy six again. But none of the founding fathers were like on July 4th, we declare our independence. Then on July 5th we got that beach house in Cabo, Thomas Furin. It's going to be liberal.  And look, obviously, I want this woman to be held accountable for her actions, but I also kind of want to party with her in Mexico.  I mean, think about it. If she and her friends can turn a boring election certification vote into this, you best believe this spring breaks are going to be wild.  And look, I know a lot of people are angry about the story, but the law says that if you can post bail and you aren't a flight risk, you can go back to your life until they actually convict. You have a crime. And I'll be honest, I agree with that concept. No one should sit in a jail cell because they might be a criminal if anything. The problem I have is that people who can't afford bail have to stay in jail.  I mean, one of the courts scared of no one is easier to keep tabs on than a broke person, you know, where a broke person isn't going to Mexico or the movies or out to dinner. You want to check a broke person? They're at home. And finally, some education news.  February is Black History Month, a beautiful time in America when Americans celebrate all the black people who died rather than help the black people who are still alive. But now a debate about how to teach black history is causing a bit of a stir in one of America's least black states.  In Utah, a school reverses a decision which would have allowed parents to opt out of lessons on Black History Month. This is happening at a charter school in Ogden, Utah. Initially, the school's director said he was asked by several families to opt out and he obliged and sent out a document asking if other parents wanted to do the same thing. But now the school is backtracking after pushback from parents and black history supporters.  Wow. First of all, what an embarrassment for the school. If I were them, I'd try to play the whole thing off as an intentional history lesson.  You see parents, you wanted to opt out, but you're not allowed to just like the slaves couldn't. Black history accomplished. Now people are saying that trying to opt out of black history is racist. But even more than that, it's stupid because black history is exciting. It's got racism, war, oppression, dudes with afros and leather jackets. If you have to opt out of something, you should opt out of boring shit like trigonometry. You don't need to know that an isosceles triangle has four sides, trust me.  Regardless, though, it's a good thing the school backtracked because this is a slippery slope. If you let kids opt out of black history, then you'll have to let them opt out of white history. And then what? Asian history. And before you know what kids will be showing up to school, like back off teach. I'm just here for lunch. It's hard to give your body the nourishment it needs every day.

It really is amazing that you not only recovered, but then made it a mission to educate other people about how to stay safe. I mean, like, you know, you're a lifelong New Yorker.  When you agreed to go to press conferences with Governor Cuomo, when you agreed to be part of these briefings, when you agreed to be part of this, what were you hoping to help achieve for New York as a whole, for them to wake up, to understand how deadly and how serious this was and that we had to respect each other just like that doctor said to me in Bangkok, you know, I wanted New Yorkers to respect one another. I wanted Americans to respect one another by wearing a mask.  It's just that simple. I've helped the governor with other things, like with his Hurricane Maria relief and all of that stuff. But for him to call me, I said, well, I told my husband, I said, isn't that crazy how the world works? When I was there at that press conference, I was holding back the emotions I really was because I didn't want to to to have that be the focus.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. I just wanted to be very adult and mature and say, listen, man, this is real messed up. It's as simple as that. If that can help, do it, do it.  Let's talk about the new show. It is generating quite the buzz and it's a really fun conceit. You know, the flight attendant when I saw the title, I was like, oh, this is cute. What is this going to be like, a romantic comedy? Is this going to be just like a straight comedy? And it's like, no, this is a dark, but sometimes funny and really gripping show about like a murder mystery. And when the show started, I remember being like, oh, Rosie, this is wonderful.  You're playing such a nice character. This is great. But now I'm not so sure and I don't know what's coming up because the show we can't binge on it comes out weekly. But it seems like you play a really shady character in this world.  You will find out. You will find out. I'd like to say I can't, but Megan is my character, Megan Briscoe. She's definitely keeping a big, fat secret. And and it's it's slowly going to be tearing her apart. And and also, she I love playing this character because at first the executive producers had in mind her being a little bit more tough. And I said, no, this woman is menopausal. She hates her life, her middle class life, which is actually fabulous, but she just can't see it.  And she her only friend is Kasey Bowdon Callicles character who doesn't feel the same way about her. I said, that's pretty sad. That's pretty sad. Right? Without judging her, I wanted to bring something special to it, you know what I mean? And I know exactly what you mean.  Yeah. What attracted you to the show? Why did you go Noize? Rosie Perez. I'm going to do the show.  A drunk flight attendant that sleeps with first class passengers and then wakes up next to one of her conquests and he's dead. I wasn't.  But actually, I turned it down. I did. I turned it down initially because I can't stand traveling. I detest it. I hate the whole thing. Really? Yes. I cannot stand it.  And the show went to locations around the globe. Yes.  That's what Kelly Kelly Kelly Cocozza, to her credit, refused to take no for an answer and met with no. And she said, you know, it's called a flight attendant. I said, yes, that's why I'm saying no. And and we were cracking up. And after an hour, that was supposed to be ten minutes, she charmed my ass off. She just did it. She did it. But inside I was like, oh, my God, I'm so in and so in.  And I was so glad I'm so glad she she she did that. And because we had a blast and everybody on the cast is stellar, just really. Oh, I loved it.  Yeah. Well, I'll tell you now, I'm glad that she chewed you shoot your head off for not doing it. I'm glad. She pushed you, I'm glad that you said yes, because it's amazing seeing you on anything, but really in this show has been a ton of fun. I can't wait to see what the secret is. Rosie Perez, thank you so much for joining me on the show.  Thank you.  Don't forget, the flight attendant is available now on HBO Max. Well, that's our show for tonight. But before we go, you may have heard, but there's an important runoff election coming up in Georgia. And if you're watching this from Georgia, I wanted to remind you that the deadline to register to vote online for that election is next Monday, the 7th of December.

Today is Monday, April 5th, and I hope everybody had a happy Easter. And I hope you also enjoyed a really nice Easter egg hunt. I actually haven't found my Easter eggs yet because my trick is I wait a few weeks until all of them start to rot and then the smell gives them away.  Pretty smart, anyway, coming up on tonight's show, America has a new creepiest congressman. He discovers why women are leaving the workforce and why Georgia Republicans are switching to Pepsi. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah. Here's a. Let's kick things off with an update on covid-19, the pandemic that's harder to get rid of than a serial killer in a hockey mask this past year sometimes felt like an endless repetition of Netflix, crofts and boring little walks around the neighborhood. Hell, I took so many walks, I started naming the fire hydrants.  It was going all Yellow Springs name. Yeah. Good to see you, Richard. Where's my money, Richard? I don't forget you told me you needed to buy new not to close the water hole. And you did I kill you, Richard? I don't forget. But now things are suddenly moving very fast in the right direction. The only question is, are they moving fast enough?  After a weekend of Easter gathering's and a record number of spring break travelers, the fear this morning. Another dangerous surge is looming. Michigan now seeing the country's largest spike in cases reporting its highest daily count since early December, while infections are rising in over 20 states. Health experts aren't in agreement that a fourth wave is imminent.  We will see in the next two weeks the highest number of cases reported globally since the beginning of the pandemic. I think that there's enough immunity in the population that you're not going to see a true fourth wave of infection. What we're seeing is pockets of infection around the country.  This as the vaccine rollout is picking up pace. The CDC says more than three million doses are now being distributed every day and over 18 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated.  That's right, people. America may be entering a fourth wave of coronavirus. This pandemic is getting more spinoffs than law and order. But the good news is, and I really mean this focus on the good news, the fourth wave might not be as big as earlier waves because so many people are being vaccinated. Yeah. So in many ways, it could end up being like when the wave comes around for the fourth time at a baseball game.  Right now, the problem is that we just don't know yet. Some experts are saying things are about to get worse and some experts are saying things are getting better. It actually makes it hard to know how cautious we should be. That's why I am not taking any chances. I have started licking doorknobs again. But just to be safe, I put a condom on them first. Basically, right now we're in a race between the people who are masking and getting vaccinated and the people who are spreading the virus.  When you think about it, that's been the question with every big issue in history. Well, the people solving the problem faster than the people causing the problem are the people fixing the climate going faster than the people changing it? All the people building sewage systems faster than the people shitting in the streets. All we produce in Cancun is fast enough to fight the gutsiness. We never make enough Cong's. Regardless, you want to be one of the people fixing the problem.  So please get vaccinated so that you can go back to living your life and keep your mask on so that you can stay safe. And because time is of the essence here, if you do see the coronavirus, you know what you're going to do. You've got to stall. Oh, hey, Korona, yeah, I know you want to come into my lungs, but before that I was just wondering, do you have any good podcasts you'd recommend?  Oh, wow. With serial killers. Oh, that's cool. And then like. Oh, so did I.  Yeah, that's right. I got the vaccine beatch.  But let's move on now to some political news.  Donald Trump may have lost the twenty twenty election, but that's only if you count all the votes against him. The good news, though, is that doesn't mean he walked away from the race empty handed.  Well, Trump supporters may have gotten or given more than they bargained for when they donated to his reelection campaign. And New York Times investigation found the people who thought they were sending a single donation were charged over and over again by his campaign operation and what the Times calls an intentional scheme to boost revenue. Recurring online donations were set up by default. Here is how that fine print disclaimer look. Take a look at this. It was buried. That tiny line at the bottom of the first yellow box calls for a weekly recurring donation.  Hundreds of thousands of people had money withdrawn without their knowledge, leading to a record amount of fraud claims against more than sixty four million bucks in refunds in the last months of twenty twenty.  The sixty three year old man willingly initially contributed five hundred dollars to the Trump campaign when the man who had his bank account repeatedly charged five hundred dollars several times in the weeks to come to the tune of three thousand dollars in less than 30 days.  God damn. Say what you want about Donald Trump, but this man is a legend, his last act as president was to rob his own supporters.  They loved him so much, they stormed the Capitol for him. And meanwhile, he was like, you go on ahead. I'll watch your stuff. Leave your wallet here, Bobby. I got you. What's most surprising to me is that Trump's base didn't expect this from him, because if you know Donald Trump at all, you should know that he will scam anyone. That's why even when Melania is at home, she still takes her purse with her to the bathroom.  I'm going people now. Credit card comes with me, Donald. Now, you probably think that after getting scammed, his supporters would have second thoughts about him. But it turns out some of the victims still say that they are loyal to Donald Trump. I mean, how far does he have to go for these guys to stop believing in him? Well, sure. I missed that check box to let Trump take my nose, but that's my fault.  I would still shake the man's hand. If I had a hand because I missed that checkbox to and finally there's another political story that we missed while we were off the air last week. And, you know, normally when we miss a political scandal, we just say a big deal and we wait for the next one because it's fine. Scandals about politicians come around more often than YouTube.  Apologies, but this story is so insane that we just have to talk about it.  Stunning new allegations that Florida Republican Matt Gates paid women for sex. The Justice Department is investigating whether the congressman in a local Florida politician gave cash or other items of value to multiple women who are recruited online to sleep with them. The men allegedly told women to meet at hotels and that some of the encounters reportedly involved the drug Ecstasy. The inquiry is also examining whether Gates had a sexual relationship with a 17 year old girl and possibly violated sex trafficking laws. Sources tell us that as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, female colleagues referred to him as, quote, creepy gates because he made them feel so uncomfortable once in Congress.  Sources say Gates allegedly boasted of his sexual encounters with women and would allegedly tried to show colleagues photos and videos of naked women. He'd claimed he'd slept with one source saying he tried to show him video of a naked woman with a hula hoop.  OK, this is crazy, Matt Gates, Florida congressman and only living relative of Beavis and Butthead being accused of sex crimes.  And there are a lot of different accusations happening here now, do I think that Matt Gates looks like a guy who shows photos of naked women to people at work? Yes, but do I think that he would have paid for sex? Yeah, definitely. But do I think that he's the kind of guy who would take ecstasy and have sex with an underage girl also? Yes. So really, there's only one question left for Gates. Does he deny all of the charges or does he admit to everything and just become king of Florida and not forget these allegations would be criminal no matter what.  But the fact that he's in Congress makes them even worse, because at what point in the day is he showing all of these nude videos? And that's why Americans should be free to choose their own health care. And speaking of free, check out these days, but let's move on to our main story, voting.  It's democracy's rose ceremony. Ever since last November's election, when Democrats turned out in large numbers, Republicans around the country have been working hard to make voting harder. And last week, the biggest voter restriction law just passed in one of the states with the results were the closest.  A new law signed by Georgia's governor, Brian Camp imposes a series of new restrictions on elections in the state.  Let's remind folks about what that law does. It shrinks the window for sending absentee ballots severely limits the number of ballot drop boxes and gives more control of local elections to state lawmakers who are majority Republican. It also makes it a crime to give water or food to people waiting in line to vote.  President Biden last week slammed the Republican backed law as sick.  When I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagles'.  Yeah, you tell him Biden. And then maybe explain what you just told him, because I have no idea what you're talking about, like, is he saying eagles are worse than crows? Like, are we all supposed to share his personal burden rankings because I don't know about you, but this is the most Joe Biden thing ever. He's trying to make a point about America's history of racist voting restrictions. And instead, he's got us arguing about birds.  Look, man, I agree. Eagles ought to go, but you can't be disrespecting the crow like that, man. You show me another bird that could use a tool to obtain food. She. But that's right. After losing in November, Georgia Republicans decided to basically make voting more like all of the worst parts of flying. OK, so there's going to be really long lines. No one can have water. And if you like, you can go yourself.  In fact, you know what? No shoes. Everybody take off your shoes. So obviously, a lot of people were upset about this law. Democrats were angry. Black people were angry. The president was angry. So for help, they turned to the only people whose opinions might actually count for something giant corporations.  More fallout now over the new voting law in Georgia. Major League Baseball pulled the all star game out of Atlanta. And over the weekend, the Braves covered up the all star patch on their uniform. MLB decision comes after civil rights groups put pressure on organizations and corporations to pull business out of Georgia.  Two major Georgia based companies, Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines, are now taking the same stance, arguing the Republican law was based on a lie and will restrict voting rights. Delta CEO Ed Bastian spoke to CBS This Morning. The right to vote is sacrosanct, and we can't do anything to send a message to people that we're going to make it more restrictive and harder to have their voice heard.  That's right. Corporate America has come out in force against Georgia's new laws. Delta and Coke spoke out. The MLB moved its All-Star Game and decided to film the next season of Atlanta in Alaska. Who paperboys not going to be happy. And look, it's great to see corporations use their influence and support of voting rights. But but just to be clear, they didn't do this out of the goodness of their hearts, right? They did it because liberals were threatening to boycott them if they didn't speak out.  And it's actually amazing what you can get companies to do when you threaten a boycott. I mean, just the threat of a boycott got Coca-Cola to back a voting rights group. Think about that. That means with just a little more pressure, we can probably convince Coke to put cocaine back in the drinks business people. But I guess I'm not surprised that they gave in because a lot of these companies aren't exactly in a great position to negotiate. Well, you can't boycott Delta Airlines because what are you going to do, fly a different airline?  Oh, yeah. Oh, well, when you put it that way, I guess we'll put out a statement. Now, here's the problem for these corporations. Any time they try to make one side of an issue, happy, people on the opposite side are going to get pissed off, which is exactly what happened next.  Georgia based companies are facing backlash from Republicans after expressing their dissatisfaction with that state's new voting law. Now, Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola have found themselves in a heated fight with Governor Brian Kemp after Delta's CEO Ed Bastian condemned the restrictive voting rights bill. Republicans in the state legislature are looking at increasing taxes on the company in retribution. A group of Georgia House Republicans is canceling Coca-Cola. They're saying Pepsi is OK after the company's CEO spoke out against the state's new restrictive voting law, asking for all Coke products to be removed from their offices.  GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted, quote, Guess what I am doing today? Not watching baseball, followed by four exclamation marks.  Former President Donald Trump is calling for conservatives to boycott corporations, saying it's finally time for Republicans and conservatives to fight back. Boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, Viacom, CBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS and Merck. The radical left will destroy our country if we let them. We will not become a socialist nation. Adding Happy Easter. OK, first of all, I love how he just threw Happy Easter in there. I mean, forget politics.  I think Trump needs to start a line of greeting cards. How Joe Biden's laptop exposes the whole Russia. The election was rigged and Batmitzvah. But more importantly, Trump has now called for boycotting the NFL and MLB. I mean, at this rate, pretty soon the only sport left for him to watch will be what soccer? And I actually think that he'll like it, especially the flopping. Mr. President, an important part of the sport is making it seem like your opponent did something wrong when in fact, they didn't.  It truly is the beautiful game. And honestly, you've got to feel for the GOP because they spend so much time defending corporate interests, trying to cut corporate taxes, letting corporations do whatever they want. And then the corporations are just like, cool, now we have more money to pay Colin Kaepernick. Not only that, Democrats are like, we will disband every corporation and make them pay.  And Coke and Delta are like, yes, queen slay us. But this is tough for these corporations to I mean, they really miss the old days, you know, when they didn't have to take sides on voting rights or culture wars. They just made dipoles out of asbestos and that was that. But these days, being a corporation means trying to navigate all these political issues without getting boycotted, which is not easy. But luckily, we have an idea for how they can avoid this problem altogether.  Here at Delta Airlines, we've heard your concerns. You want us to speak out against voter suppression and you want us to speak out for voter suppression."}]}

Kendi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're listening to Comedy Central now. So we're starting, we're rolling. Are we already recording, looking at your notes, so official. Hey, guys, it's Brian Baumgartner. Maybe you've heard my podcast, an oral history of the Office, where we go deep into the making of the show now. Well, you can go even deeper. That's what she said, because I am sharing my full length conversations with the cast and crew of the office. Listen to the office deep dive starting on February the 9th on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.  Hey, everybody, what's going on? I'm Trevor Noah. This is the Daily Social Distancing Show. And today is February 2nd, also known as day two of Black History Month. So let's party people bust down some of that sweet black history music.  We do what we do anyway on tonight's show.  Another reason you might not want to get on a plane, what Reddit learned from watching Wall Street and Biden. Better have my money. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's Koch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with children.  All year before we get started, today is Groundhog Day, which leads me to ask, what the hell is Groundhog Day?  People pull a rodent out of the ground and then ask the animal to predict the weather. Really, this is so unfair, because if Africans were doing shit like this and you heard that we pulled animals out of the ground, like there are villages in Africa where people wear animal skin. And if I try to explain to them that Americans use groundhogs to predict the weather, they'd be like, but why not use satellite data? But let's move on from talking animals to emailing vegetables.  It sounds too crazy to believe scientists really have taught spinach to send emails.  All right, here's how it works. Just break it down to engineers at MIT report that spinach roots can detect a compound found in explosives like landmines when the roots detect the compound, molecules in the roots release a signal. That signal is then read by an infrared camera, which sends an email alert to scientists. The purpose of the experiment is to detect explosives, but scientists believe it could be used to warn researchers of pollution. The experiment is part of a wider field of research that involves engineering electronic systems in the plants.  It is also called Plant Nano Bionics.  All right. I'm sorry, guys. This is insane. I mean, who emails anymore? Just DM me spinach. Seriously, spinach, D.M. me.  But you also know what this means. If spinach just got on e email, it means that they're not as savvy about it as everyone else. So let me be the first to say good. My dearest friend, spinach. I have a million dollars in a trust that I suddenly cannot access until the first day of lunch. If you are able to allow me to a thousand dollars, I will pay you back fifteen times over. Please, spinach. I need you.  And now we play the waiting game. Congressman, congratulations to the scientists who are working on this breakthrough. And now that they've told spinach how to send an email, maybe they can move on to the next scientific frontier. Teaching your mom how to use face time.  How do I turn the camera? Mom, I've got to go. Just ask the spinach. Moving on to the coronavirus pandemic.  It's the reason sweatpants on our business expense. Yesterday, Western Australia went into total lockdown after discovering its first coronavirus case in 10 months. You see, Australia is very different from the United States. In the US, water goes down the drain clockwise and in Australia they care about stopping coronavirus. Now, part of the reason for Australia's success is that Australians don't resist the government as much when they tell them that they should stay at home. And it's partly because these people know that covid is a serious disease.  It's also partly because it lets Australians stay away from all the other things in Australia that could kill them. Yeah, it's bad enough that the scorpions and snakes are trying to kill me, but there's a koala that's trying to give me a nasty day. Now, eventually, of course, the world will reemerge from the pandemic.  And I know everyone thinks that they're going to jump right back into their old lives, you know, like going to bars or theatres or using the bottom half of your face to express emotion. But you might want to prepare for a period of adjustment because some things apparently take a little time to relearn.  A new report says some. Pilots are getting rusty on the job due to the pandemic because, well, there are fewer planes to fly. Some pilots grounded for months by the pandemic have seen their skills and proficiency suffer. For instance, one pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake, damaging a tow truck that was trying to pull that plane from the gate. In another case, the pilot forgot to turn on the empty icing mechanism. Other reports include lining up the wrong runway for landing.  To counter such rustiness, the FAA stops pilots from flying a commercial jet unless they have performed at least three takeoffs and three landings, either on a plane or in a simulator in the previous 90 days.  I don't know about you, but this is kind of scary. Apparently, you never forget how to ride a bike, but you forget how to fly a plane after like five days.  Oh, man, this is going to change everything. Next time the plane hits turbulence, the pilot's going to jump on the intercom like, are there any hijackers on board?  We need someone who knows how to fly the plane. Harpreet, any hijackers, please make yourself known to the cabin crew.  And listen, I get that pilots are human and everyone makes mistakes at their jobs, but there are certain jobs where there is way less room for error. You know, like as a mail carrier, you might say, oh, whoops, this package was supposed to go to apartment two and accidentally sent it to apartment three. But as a pilot, it's more like a Poopsie. These people were supposed to go to Miami and I accidentally sent them to heaven.  And trust me, now, this is not just going to be pilots, people. Everyone is going to be rushing off to covid projectionists are going to be showing movies upside down. Bouncers are going to be letting in groups of ugly dudes and telling beautiful women they got on the wrong shoes. Bullies are going to give you their lunch money. Meanwhile, until the pandemic is actually over, Americans are going to need more help getting through it. And the big question of what that help will look like is dominating Washington, D.C. right now.  President Biden's pledge of bipartisanship facing its first test tonight. The president inviting 10 Republican senators to the Oval Office to pitch their covid relief counteroffer. Their six hundred billion dollar proposal is a mere fraction of the president's one point nine trillion dollar package. The GOP plan leaves out a minimum wage boost. The president includes and whittles down his fourteen hundred dollar direct payments to Americans to one thousand dollars.  Still, when all was said and done, the White House did not appear to be conceding much ground, saying the president will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.  This is a sign of this effort from President Biden to get bipartisanship here. But it also comes as Democrats on Capitol Hill are paving the way to move forward with only Democratic votes for this relief package.  Look, man, I'm not going to lie. I get why Democrats and Republicans are having trouble agreeing on this relief package. I mean, this is a difference of one point three trillion dollars. How do you compromise when you're that far apart? It's like deciding what you want to get for dinner and you want something nice, but your date wants to eat out of a gas station, trash can. You can't compromise and eat out of a nice trash can.  But I also do love how Republicans suddenly get stingy the second that a Democrat comes into office, because don't forget, during the Trump years, they were handing out tax cuts with a strip of money gun. But now that Biden is president, suddenly they're trying to hand out covid relief a penny at a time, one penny to OpenEdge. Am I making it rain yet? Three pennies? Yes. More of a drizzle. I agree. Now, a lot of people are upset about the Democrats plan to give people fourteen hundred dollars because they say that the Democrats promised to give people two thousand dollars.  But the Democrats are arguing that everybody already got the first six hundred a month ago. And I get the Democrats point on this one. But at the same time, so many people are struggling right now. Why not just give them twenty six hundred instead? I mean, you can find the money somewhere to take it from space. What? Trump is gone. We don't have to pretend that that's the thing anymore. And finally, let's move on to the second most talked about Instagram video from last night's Ofter Courtside Karen The Post by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who gave a harrowing account of her personal experience during the capital attack.  We're getting an eye opening new look inside last month's siege on the US Capitol. Ocasio Cortez describing the impact of the riots, sharing details about what happened to her during the insurrection at the Capitol, telling her viewers she felt like she was going to die.  All of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on my door like this, like I'm here.  And the bathroom door starts going like this, like the bathroom door is behind me or rather in front of me. And I'm like this. And the door hinges right here.  And I just hear, where is she? Where is she? And this was the moment.  Where? I thought everything was over, you know, I just happened to. You know, be a spiritual person and be raised in that context, and I really just felt like, you know. If this is the plan for me. Then people will be able to take it from here. Wow. You know, for a lot of us at home, the capital riots were basically an action movie on TV. I mean, it was scary, intense and terrifying, but at the end of the day, we were just watching it.  But an action movie is very different when you are actually in the movie. I mean, AOC and other members of Congress literally thought that they were going to die on a Wednesday afternoon, no less. I mean, nobody should die in the middle of the week. That means you went to work on Monday and Tuesday for nothing. And thank God that no members of Congress were actually hurt. But even just believing that you're going to die is a major trauma.  And ABC handled it way better than I would have. I mean, she was like, if this is where my journey ends, so be it. If I thought about it, I wouldn't be pondering my journey. I'd be trying to delete my browser history. And to everyone out there who's saying, oh, how scared could she really have been? How scared could she have been? Think about how terrified you get when someone knocks on the bathroom door when there isn't even a riot.  Someone's in here. Oh, God, no. They're going to know that I poop. So I'm glad that ABC shed the story because many Republicans in Congress would like to just pretend that this shit never happened, that the lives of Congress members and their staff weren't in danger, and that police officers guarding the Capitol weren't injured and killed. But if there's no accountability, then it becomes easier and easier for it to happen again. And the last thing we need from this action movie is a sequel.  Right. When we come back, we'll look at why hedge funds are so mad about the GameStop uprising. And Ibrahim Scandi is joining us on the show.  So don't go away. What do explorers, an Army officer and a Minnesota insurance salesman have in common, they all wanted to be the first to reach the North Pole, but only one of them made it. I'm Katlehong, science editor at Mental Floss and host of the new podcast The Quest for the North Pole, which dives into the centuries long race to explore the Arctic, find the Northwest Passage and conquer the top of the world with a cast of daring adventurers and some pretty determined amateurs, the race to the poll reveals the human desire to solve mysteries of geography and the soul.  We'll look at the important Arctic expeditions that filled the blank spaces on the map and recognize how indigenous people made them successful. We'll examine what pushed explorers to venture ever farther into the unknown and uncharted and how the climate crisis is changing the Arctic today. Listen to the quest for the North Pole every Friday on the radio app, Apple podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Robert Evans, host of Behind the Bastards, and it could happen here, and boy, it does seem to be happening here.  I'm going to guess most of the people listening to this are deeply concerned with what they saw happen in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. And I'm here to tell you, it was a fascist insurrection, an attempt by fascists to take over our democracy. And it didn't happen in a historical vacuum. There have been numerous attempts, many of them successful by fascist movements, to take over democracies over the last century in order to protect yourself, in order to protect your family and your very freedom, you need to understand this history and the history of the different antifascist movements that have fought, sometimes successfully, often unsuccessfully, to stop the same things from happening in their own countries.  The knowledge of this history is important, and it's maybe the only thing that can save us. So if you were as concerned as I am, listened to behind the insurrections on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. By now, you've probably heard about the GameStop uprising, but the biggest thing to happen with video games since it got busted for doping. But if you haven't heard the news, what happened was that some Wall Street hedge funds bets a lot of money that the stock price of the video game store GameStop would fall.  But a bunch of people on Reddit found out about those bets. So they started buying GameStop shares so that the price would go up and the hedge funds would lose a lot of money and lose a lot of money they did in the billions of dollars. So as you can imagine, Wall Street is pretty unhappy with those Reddit investors.  A handful of industry leaders are calling for an investigation because of the angry mob that's formed against them.  Last week was a free market. It was a free for all market, no doubt about it.  For my twenty five years in the business, I've never seen this form of collusion on such a widespread fashion. This type of behavior is not the behavior that you want to be replicating. I think there is something obviously wrong, and it's the gamification of Wall Street.  Talk to an analyst this morning, guys, who said this is dangerous. They forget they're buying a stock in a piece of a company. It's not just some symbol that you play hot potato with it.  Just because you throw the Hail Mary pass in your back yard and it's caught for the touchdown in the wind. Doesn't mean you're Tom Brady.  What's going through my mind is how irrelevant I feel and how every day I just don't want to get out of bed and how it's the least amount of fun I think I've ever had.  Oh, read these Wall Street guys are taking this so hard that the interviews are just turning into therapy sessions.  I feel so irrelevant right now and I'm not having any fun. And I just remembered my parents never hung my paintings on the refrigerator.  But the truth is, what the Redskins did here is nothing new. In fact, the only thing that makes this so unique is that this is just the first time that the little guy has used the big guys tactics against him, because when it comes to manipulating the market and treating trades like a game, no one is better at it than Wall Street."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about White Supremacy in America Compilation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The only thing he avoids more than condemning white supremacists is paying taxes. So, look, I get why his supporters want to act like Trump's proud boys moment last night was some kind of accidental or unintentional gaffe. But if you see someone making the same mistake over and over again, at some point, you have to accept that it's not a mistake.  It's their belief.  Let me ask you this, you you talked to some people who and without your show, I don't think you'd ever talk to, you know, like whether it's like people who are in the Klan used to be in the Klan, very racist, very homophobic, very anything. And I'm not going to lie. You seem to get along well with them as human beings like you seem to like. And you are very black as well. I mean, like, you know what I'm saying?  It's not like you and you sneaking in. You're a black and white.  When I see exactly you come in as a black man, they see you as a black man, and then you guys seem to be tall, 400 pounds.  So I wanted to know, have you maintained any type of friendship with these people post the show, or has it just like you, just like like do you get to know them as human beings or are they just cordial to you, as comfortable as an individual? And then I'm like, cool with black people. Yeah.  I mean, certainly it's not I would say it's not American history x where I do laundry with them for an hour and then they come out and go, man, I shouldn't be a racist.  It's not quite that easy if only it was. But I do think people go, oh, this is not what I expected. I see this guy differently. It's not going to happen in one day or one one conversation. The thing I understood about this whole racism discussion is that in the whole image of racism, it's a long struggle and it takes time.  But do you think from your experience that some of it could be helped by the conversations, or is that just like a that's just like a hopeful, mythical world that we sometimes dream of?  I mean, some of it can be helped by the conversation. But if those people don't go into the voting booth and vote based on what they learn in the conversation, then it's just a conversation. So I think sometimes we over prioritize the conversation like me. And that race has had a conversation that felt good. But it's actually like about how people evolve over time. And I think that's the conversation part of the.  Your writing has, I mean, made a lot of people feel uncomfortable, a lot of white people, a lot of white men in particular, uncomfortable, and that was before your current book, Mediocre, which is about the dangers of white male mediocrity. Talk me through what that means. Absolutely.  So this was a book kind of written out of frustration. If you write on issues of race and gender in America, especially since twenty sixteen, you see all these think pieces, you know, why is Chad so angry? Why is this white man so upset? And what I wanted people to look at was the political structure behind the time that we're in. I want to people that this rise in like, you know, hate filled, racist, violent, white male political ideology is by design.  And so I want people to look at that because we have to change how we act and what we value as a society if we want to solve this problem. So that's really what we're looking at, is a history in America of how we have actually made it beneficial or at least seem beneficial to white men to act like the only definition of success is power over women and people of color and really what it's cost us over multiple generations.  When you when you look at this conversation, though, I mean, obviously, there's so much resistance. There are a lot of white men who are like, I have nothing. So how dare you say that I have any of this mediocrity or this power that comes with it? How can you say, I don't see any of this power? I live in West Virginia. I have no no money. I have barely any food. Where is this white power that you are speaking of?  How do you try and and and if you even do try, explain that to white people in those situations? Because oftentimes I find that will be some of the base that has riled up where they're told you have this privilege and these positions and they go, but I don't see it.  Absolutely. And I think it's important to recognize first and foremost, privilege is relative. Right. So if you're standing if you're an average everyday white man standing in a room with Oprah Winfrey, chances are in many areas she has more privilege than you. But if she is standing next to a white millionaire or billionaire, chances are she has less privilege. It's situational depending on where you're at. But I think it's really important to recognize that white supremacy in this country is a pyramid scheme.  So it's really the idea. You play along and you will have more. You will have more than more than women. Quite often it doesn't work out that way. And that's part of why we see the anger is that people bought into the system, they're playing along, they've been promised and they voted accordingly. They've spent their money accordingly that their greatness is coming. And when it doesn't, who do they blame? Often people like me, people like you, because they've been told you're supposed to be better off.  And so a lot of that anger that says I don't have that I don't have it ignores the fact that you were probably ever going to get it, but you were promised that. And that becomes a political problem and it becomes a part of the violence that often some white men end up supporting.  There's no denying as America becomes more and more diverse, the group of white men that we are talking about are going to become more and more resistant because they're going, oh, I'm losing my grip on, as you said, that promise of my place in America. So how do we get to a place where we invite people into the conversation without pandering, but still invites people in and going like, oh, no, hey, this is for everybody's benefit.  It's not about you losing and me winning. It's about everybody winning as opposed to buying into the pyramid scheme.  You know, it's definitely something I talk about a bit in the book, right? The real harm that this actually does to white men, the system being told that your payout coming in, it never does. And the sense of failure that often accompanies white men when they've bought into this. But I think it's also really important to recognize that I personally am not writing to create a kinder, gentler white man. I'm writing because I am a black woman being harmed by this system and the way it works.  But I do hear from white men who say, you know, you've named a thing I couldn't name. You've named the disappointment a constant yearning for more that I couldn't name. But I don't expect that, you know, a white man who's angry and, you know, is completely in a political opposite for me is going to pick up my book. But what I do expect is that people who know something's wrong are going to start looking at our values, our systems and changing it.  And then the white men who come up in these systems come up differently, right the way in which the power that this violence has is lessened. And that's really what my goal is.

Brought to you by the General Literacy Foundation and the Ad Council. Hey, what's going on, everybody? Welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show. I'm Trevor Noah. Today is Tuesday, the 15th of December, which means Christmas is only 10 days away. Now, remember, when you wrap up the two turtle doves, put some air holes in the box, you want to spend Christmas Day digging a grave. Anyway, coming up on tonight's show.  President Trump is on his way out. President Biden is on his way in and President Obama is here on the show. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the daily social justice show with children all year. Let's talk about Christmas traditions. Every culture has them, whether it's Americans leaving cookies for Santa, the Dutch putting on blackface to play Santas, magical Negro helper, or Brazil, where Santa grooms his beard specially for the occasion. But in Wisconsin, the government's Grinch is trying to steal one very special Christmas tradition.  A Wisconsin tradition may be under attack after the Wisconsin DHS warned against consuming raw beef sandwiches this holiday season. The popular treat known as Cannibal Sandwich, or the Wild Cat, is often served at holiday parties and other gatherings here in Wisconsin.  Since nineteen eighty six, there have been eight raw meat related outbreaks in the state of Wisconsin, and that includes a salmonella outbreak affecting more than one hundred and fifty people in December of nineteen ninety four.  Despite the warning, so many people say they have no plans of ending their traditional Christmas tradition.  Every year our family before Christmas and New Year's, we might go through three to four hundred pounds each day. We warn the people who say this is raw meat, you should be cooking it. But when they take it home, they can do what they want.  A cannibal sandwich.  OK, I don't want to hear any more shit from Americans about what other countries eat to Africans eat bugs yet, but we cook them first.  You savages. I mean, why would you even want to eat raw ground beef? I've never eaten a burger and said, Mom, this is good, but I wish there was a chance I would die, although I love how they dress it up with the onion because raw beef by itself, that's gross. But you add a raw onion and now it's like, oh, cuisine. Honestly, guys, I can't even follow Christmas anymore. It just started out as the birth of Jesus.  Then we added elves in the North Pole and magical snowmen and now you guys are adding cannibal sandwiches. I mean, at some point there will be anything the holidays aren't about. You guys will be like, Yeah, baby, I texted my ex. But that's just a Christmas tradition. It's not cheating. All right.  Moving on to video games. It's the other reason your nephew's wrist hurts. Blockbuster games these days are so huge that sometimes even with years of testing, developers still can't get everything right. But one new game has so many bugs, the company was forced to accept responsibility.  The creators of one of the year's most anticipated video games is apologizing. Just days after its release, Cyberpunk 2077 has been plagued with bugs and crashes since its debut. Now CD project Red is offering refunds for customers unsatisfied with the game. Cyberpunk 2077, which features cameos from Keanu Reeves and Elon Musk, is an action role playing game set in megalopolis. Developers say the sixty dollars game was pre ordered more than eight million times.  Wow, guys, do you know how bad something has to be to have Keanu Reeves in it and people still don't like it? I mean, someone could serve me the cannibal sandwich, but if they said it was Keanu Reeves, I'd be like, I mean, I hate what you did to Keanu, but that's probably a good sandwich, am I right now, in case you're wondering, what kind of glitches would be so bad that people would demand their money back?  Well, in some cases, players would suddenly see the character's penis poking through the pants. Yeah, and that was a huge glitch. I mean, not like a huge glitch, an average sized glitch, really. Look, it's not about the size of the glitch. It's just about anyway, let's move on. Oh, and it's not just penises either. Some characters would have their breasts pop out of the shirts. Yeah. And can I just say, kids today are soft.  You're seeing dicks and boobs in the game and you want your money back. You're in my day. If there was a niche where you could see boobs and dicks, we'd pay double for that game. I dreamed of getting to see any kind of genitalia in a video game. I used to have to take a Sharpie and draw a dick on Pacman.  You youngbloods know nothing about the struggles of moving on to something with even more bugs than cyberpunk American democracy. It has been three years since Joe Biden won the twenty twenty presidential election, but yesterday he did it again.  President elect Joe Biden took another critical step toward the White House today with a vote by the country's electors known as the Electoral College.  Formalizing his victory ceremonies at state capitols across the country are usually a mere formality. But with the president refusing to accept defeat, the electors today found themselves in the spotlight.  Legislative offices in Michigan were closed yesterday amid threats of violence, and state police had to block a group of pro Trump supporters from entering the capital.  The capital is closed. Or if you are taking part of the process, anybody else from at a lower level, the electors are here. They've been checked out.  I love that office's patients, but we're also electors. Yes, you are. And you look so good in your elector costumes. But this meeting is only for grown ups. So why don't you guys go to the park and play your sore loser game over there?  OK, and don't get me wrong, I'm glad that the system worked. But it is weird that this is the system. I mean, everyone has known that Joe Biden was elected for a month, but if those guys had somehow managed to sneak into the room, then they could have screwed up the whole thing. I mean, what would have happened if that cop had been 50 percent dumber and let those guys in, huh? You don't want your democracy to depend on a bouncer.  But yes, for the 30th time, Donald Trump's attempts to undo the election have once again finally come to an end. And even some of his biggest enablers are accepting reality.  President Trump refuses to concede, but top Republicans now congratulating Biden. I think the race is over.  Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey is helping the Philadelphia Inquirer quote, The outcome of the election is clear, and that is that Joe Biden won the election.  Senate Majority Whip John Thune said of South Dakota said it's time for everybody to move on.  The Electoral College has spoken. So today I want to congratulate President elect Joe Biden.  Overnight, Russian President Vladimir Putin finally acknowledging Biden's victory, congratulating him in a telegram, reportedly writing in part, I am ready for interaction and contacts with you.  I am ready for interaction and contacts with you. Putin doesn't sound human. He sounds like a self checkout at the CVS. Ready for action, please, to place item in the big. Seriously, guys, what a weird phrase. I am ready for interaction and contacts with you. Sounds like Mike Pence getting frisky. And you know, Trump's luck has run out now that Mitch McConnell has conceded the election because forget Putin, if Mitch can't find a way to subvert American democracy, then it just can't be done.  And there's another sure sign that Trump's time is coming to an end. One of his most loyal minions is saying peace out.  Moments after the Electoral College made Mr Biden's victory official, President Trump announced Attorney General William Barr resigned. Mr Trump said Barr will leave his post next week after the pair met yesterday at the White House.  Lately, President Trump has been upset that bars of the Department of Justice found no evidence of widespread fraud in the twenty twenty election, a direct contradiction of the president's false claims. Boehner has also admitted the president's interference of the Department of Justice made his job impossible.  Yes, Bulbar has officially resigned, which surprised some people because for a long time it seemed like he was right or die with Trump. He whitewashed the media reports. He protected Trump's cronies, even reportedly ordered peaceful protesters to be tear gassed just so that Trump could walk over to a church and wave a Bible next to it. And when the White House chef prepared brussel sprouts, ball would hide under the table so Trump could feed them to him. The point is, these people were like Batman and Robin if Batman and Robin couldn't fit into their tights.  But Trump also wanted to overturn the election results and Barr wouldn't do that. So one of two things has happened here either, but quit because Trump became too batshit crazy even for him, or Trump fired back because he's not batshit crazy enough to roll in this White House. Either way, this works out the best football because everyone is heading out on January 20th. So this way, at least, billboards beating the traffic. But let's move on, because it's easy to forget that Donald Trump hasn't always been the president.  And only this week I sat down with President Barack Obama for a wide ranging conversation. We talked about the challenges facing the world, his message to young activists and workshopping slogans with Michelle. Enjoy.  Are you going to filibuster me or because I don't have all the time, you want to be very good. So is this like a roundabout way of saying you just want me to give short, pithy? No, I don't want your questions. You want me to speed up? You want me to talk fast?  No, no, no, no.  Please, Mr. President, I will not I will not purposely filibuster, but sometimes I will have a pause as I'm formulating my thoughts, as you well know. Michelle, Michelle has been speeding up my auto my my audio book. So I guess you can press a button. So, yeah, you can point to five or one and a half. Yes, yeah, yeah. You were one and a half guy. You did one and a half day.  I was a little offended by that, but that's okay. That's fine.  It does it doesn't communicate the depth of feeling with which I'm doing the reading, but it's OK.  How do you like being referred to? Like just a human being. Do you like Mr. President? People call. Barack, but then sometimes some folks feel awkward doing it, obviously, that's what my friends call me. So I consider you a friend, but you may feel you. So, no, no, no.  The people the people will feel like like even Africans will. They'll write me a letter saying, how dare you? This is my fault, too.  So I don't want to get you in trouble. So you can say, Mr. President, makes sense. You can call me Protus. My favorite one was.  Oh, Bizzle. That was my favorite. Please call me that. Mr. President, welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show.  I am very happy to be here with you. You're out there promoting a brand new book, A Promised Land, a 700 page book, if I may add. I love reading your stuff, don't get me wrong. But like, I would have like three fifty three fifty seven hundred pages, you know, I would have I would have broken it up even more, but.  You know, the publishers thought that breaking it up into two volumes would be about right.  And look, the goal of the book was to give people a sense of what it's like to be in the White House. Right, as a normal person, finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. And I think part of the goal, particularly for young people, I wanted them to get a sense that, you know, not everybody is going to end up being president. But if you decide that your voice makes a difference, if you decide that you can have an impact, then through the ups and downs, you will end up having some pretty extraordinary experiences.  And one, I wanted to be an encouragement for people to say, you know, the guy is OK, but he's not so special and look what he ended up doing. Maybe I can do something, something as well.  It feels like this book is Barack Obama convincing Barack Obama to remain optimistic? And what I mean by convincing Barack Obama, I think, of like a young Barack Obama, I think of a fledgling Barack Obama and not trying to emulate you, per say, but rather anyone who's trying to make a change in the world or their world. That's what that's what it feels like if you if you are writing to young people to be optimistic in the book.  What are some of the frustrations that you understand on this side that may hinder that optimism? Because if a young person says, yeah, but this system right now is crumbling more and more, how do you how do you maintain that optimism or do you think there has to be a point where they go? I'm not optimistic. I'm just fighting to break what it is to create something new.  Part of the reason that it's 700 pages long is because by reading the book, they'll see men. There are a lot of structural problems or barriers in making this place better.  We're learning right now in Vivid, a vivid example of the fact that our democracy is not the way we would imagine it to be. There are all kinds of elements to it where the most votes don't necessarily translate into the equivalent amount of power. Very popular proposals can wither on the vine because of a filibuster in the Senate. And so I don't try to gloss those over.  You know, the Paris accord did not solve climate change, but it created the first global framework whereby all countries agreed, we have to do something about this and here's a mechanism to do it. You can still be terrified about the pace at which we are burning up the planet and yet think that was a worthwhile endeavor because it gives us at least the opportunity maybe three, four or five years down the road to keep building on that. So that is the kind of mentality I want young people to have a certain impatience, a certain frustration, a certain anger about the status quo.  There are times now where, you know, you have younger activists criticizing me for Obama. Why didn't you take care of this or that or the other? And I, I welcome them feeling frustrated and impatient because that's how I was before I got started. And then they'll get their own knocks on the head and, you know, some stuff won't work out exactly the way they want. But the impulse.  Is the one that I want to encourage, because it's as a consequence of that, that constant striving and imagining something better, that things don't get exactly as we want it, but they get better. You're a very serious person because, I mean, you're a president of the United States, but at the same time, you're a lot more fun than a lot of people think.  You know, I'm constantly trying to explain to people I'm a funny guy, but but I don't know. But you're right. But you really are. You really, really are. And what I liked in the book is there are moments where there's just like a roasting of people or life like the G20. I've never I've never heard of a world leader."}]}

It's my first time being on your show. It's just, you know, I'm sad that it's not in face to face or in person, but I'm glad I am.  I'm sad. I'm sad, too. But I don't like you still here. I have gotten used to this being here for me. So, you know, it's still you know, I'm going to tell me, like your personality changes when you're in person.  It does not. I'm maybe I'm more silly in person, but I've gotten silly on, you know, in June, too. I can do it both now. Just plain silly.  Before we get into talking about your projects, let's talk a little a little bit about that. I would love to know on a personal level what your life has felt like since you left the White House, because I remember and I mean, I was one of the fans, maybe because I also had had journeys. I remember everyone just being like, wow, Michelle, the afro in the has come and everyone is just like she's just she's got a different swag about her.  Wasn't there a weight that's lifted from your shoulders when leaving the White House as first lady? Absolutely.  I mean, for for so many reasons. I mean, you know, being the first lady and the press, it's a it's a huge responsibility. And being the first, you know, we felt a deep responsibility to do it right and to do it better, to be careful with our words, all the things we thought were important things like.  Thinking about what you say before you say it, you know, telling the truth, you know, getting your facts right, all of this, we were worried for no reason we could have done it so differently.  It could have been easier. But no, no, we were doing the traditional thing. And so, you know, it was a big responsibility, a big weight on our shoulders, but it was an honor to serve. And we kept our eye focused on just every day trying to show up. Right. And push the ball forward on the issues that we cared about.  But we were also doing it while raising our kids. All right. So right. You know, they were 10 and seven when we entered. They lived in the White House longer than they lived in any house they've ever lived in.  So they they were growing up right in that spotlight. And so we had that pressure of getting through the adolescent years, in the teen years and sending it to college.  So we were exhausted and stressed because not only are you trying to get it right on the big picture level, but you're trying to get it right as a parent. And now we're on the other end of that on literally on the other end of all of that.  And our kids are about to be twenty three and twenty. Our oldest is graduating from college. They are alive.  So all of that, you know, being at the end of that part of the journey, you know, it you know, I am in a different place.  I feel freer. I feel more at peace. I'm also older. So I'm more comfortable. I'm even more comfortable in my own skin.  I can imagine so. So, yeah, yeah.  It was, you know, I mean, living in the White House is like living in an nice older hotel where you can't get out unless you call 20 people.  It almost feels like you were living a sort of quarantined life before.  All of this is what I tell people. This is why we're fine. Barack and I are like, what? You can't go out just when you want to. Yeah, you're like this. We've been doing that for eight years. You've got security with you at all times. You can't make a move. And you have to think about how your movements impact the rest of the world. Every time we went out, we had to think about it.  It's like who's going to have to shut down what gate? How is this going to disrupt this whole community? Because the presidential motorcade is coming through, we have to worry about agents and not doing something that will put them in harm's way.  We're good in quarantine. We're like, welcome to our world.  Everyone has been somebody who has been not just an icon, but but somebody that people have followed so passionately from the beginning. And and what I loved about reading your book and and talking to your husband is that, you know, is getting into the familial side of things, the personal side of things. I've always wanted to know from your perspective, because a lot of people may not think of it like this because of president, but you're the cool one in the relationship.  Right.  And so like but Barack was like this, like, you know, it's like like you say in your book, who's this? Who's this like, you know what I mean. And yes, he's Mr. President, don't get me wrong. But I mean, to us, Barack, is there a part of you that like when it was done, you were like, all right, finally the power balance can go back to what it was?  Well, he's still pretty cool, you know. Oh, definitely.  But I mean, you know, I mean, it's like a game of chess. You want to lose the queen, you know that.  I'm going to use that at dinner tonight. Right.  But what's fun to see is how it feels like you are each other's biggest fans, the way you show your love towards each other. You've never been afraid to do that. But at the same time, there's also a healthy, competitive spirit. I mean, whether you're selling books, whether you're releasing your your work on Netflix and creating documentaries, is there a little bit of that when you look at your numbers and then you go, I mean, you know, you go like Barry, you doing well, but, you know you know, is there a little bit of that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Barack is super competitive, so, you know, and shoot, let me I am too. So, yeah, there's a little there's a little bit of that. I mean but you know, you can do that when you know your partner holds their own. It's it's a nice, funny joke, you know. I mean if he if he wrote his book and nobody bought it, we wouldn't be joking about it. Right. We would be like, honey, you're doing a great job.  Oh, he has a great book. Great book. We love it.  And tell your dad how much you like his book. You know, I mean, he's written like a thousand book.  You know, he's like, yeah, I've done this before.  You're the new you know, he was he fed us on his book books for a very long time. So, you know, it's a funny joke when it's, you know. Well, is not true when it's when it's not fully true, the kids are actually joking, they're talking about how, you know, Mom's doing a lot of work out there. Dad, you're at home looking kind of cute.  You know, they're like you're now the one that is hilarious. You are the cute one.  Mr. President.

Let's talk a little bit about your new project on Netflix, it is it's a passion of yours that we've known from the very beginning, and that is eating healthy. You know, America has internationally established a reputation as being the country where people have some of the most unhealthy choices in how they eat.  I remember when I came to America, I didn't understand it genuinely came to America. I ate the way I ate in South Africa, did not really care. And then I got here and I remember the first time I was traveling around the US and nobody knew me. I was doing my thing was around twenty ten and I gained I think it was 18 to 20 pounds in six months and I didn't realize this was happening to me. And then I went back to South Africa and in Africa because there's no like body shaming in that way.  Everyone was just like, wow, did you eat half of America? What happened to you? Wow. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  You know, and it was it was actually interesting because I didn't think I changed anything. I didn't. But then I came to realize how hard it is for so many Americans to eat healthy, to exist, healthy, to be healthy. And that's always been your passion, which is part of the show that you have on Netflix Waffles and watching the most adorable exploration of eating healthy. Please just talk me through why you thought, you know what? This is the avenue that I'm going to take to further this message for what I'm passionate about.  The co creators, Erica Thorn, Ellen and Jeremy Connor, you came up with this idea because, you know, Jeremy had young kids and struggled with this as a parent, getting their kids excited about vegetables. So they came up with the idea and presented it to us and kind of proposed, would you be in it? And I looked at the concept and thought this this is a no brainer. I mean, this is what we had been talking about for eight years through Let's Move is that you can have these conversations not making them punitive or not shaming people, but just beginning to introduce positive concepts about what food is, making it fun, making it enjoyable.  Now, the part that I'm excited about is the work that we're doing through the past the love campaign, where we're hoping to do more education around food insecurity and rising food deserts and reminding people that there are millions of people in this country that are going hungry even as they sit in communities with food all around them.  Right.  But it's it's it's the type of food so many families don't have access to fresh produce. If they want to buy a bundle of kale, they've got to get on a bus or it costs way too much money they don't have the ability to do at home cooking.  The Pasta Love campaign is designed to raise money to help feed a million families in this country.  What I love about waffles and mulches, I mean, we all grew up watching puppets and cartoons, and it's really fun to see these discussions. Like my favorite episode is just the arguments about whether a tomato is a fruit or vegetable. I've had this fight with people my entire life, tomatoes, avocados, whatever it is, I go, Hey man, I have a simple metric. Is it sweet? Then it's a fruit and then people want to fight with me.  And I think it's fun. It's fun to engage with that. I can imagine enjoying that with kids and having these conversations because I grew up I grew up loving vegetables and the reason I grew up loving vegetables is because we didn't always have a lot of food. And I realized very, very young that if I could learn to love the things that nobody else wanted, then I would always have have for all the other kids they were running for, like the meat and the fish.  And I was like, I'll take the broccoli, the cauliflower. And I just learned to love it. But it's cool to see from that side for the kids.  Yeah, I knew you were on the other side with pasta love.  What I've really enjoyed is you you having the conversation about the truth, about how difficult it is. You know, a lot of the time in America, people blame the victim. Yes. They go, you should be eating healthy. You should be making better choices. You should.  And then I remember when I when I first got to America, I was like, wow, how much is an avocado that's raised like this or how much is this? Because in South Africa, the treat is the McDonald's. Your family can't just buy you that every day. Right? In America, it's like, no, the fast food is affordable and that's no.  Yeah, that's how it was for us growing up. So this is also generational. I mean, the whole notion of going out wasn't something that you did. People couldn't afford it and it wasn't available like that. So going to a fast food place was a treat. But for the most part, being able to afford to live meant you had to cook. That was the cheapest way to. Yes, you bought a whole chicken. You knew how to cut it up.  You knew how to dice up some some some vegetables. You you knew how to cook a pot of greens. I mean, that's how we all grew up. And it's with this change in sort of mass-producing. The quick, easy and understandably, parents struggle with that because everybody's busy now and we're overworked, so it's easy to pick up, grab something, pop something to do something processed. And we don't realize that these processed foods are high in sugar and salt in ways that that's the kind of thing that affects you.  It's it's the content of the food.  People think, well, a French fry is a potato and it's like, well, you know, if that's all you're eating and it's fried and it's processed, you're getting extra stuff in there.  So, you know, the key, like you said, is not to shame people, not to blame folks. And that's where it gets personal because people do feel judged and criticized for doing the best that they can."}]}

Do you have any normal. You know, honestly, you when you come to America, I think you've said this before about the eating, so there's the first couple of months of just eating and thinking that it's not going to go anywhere.  And then you want to go home and everyone says, my goodness, I'm never quite so good to you.  So I try not to eat a lot. But also, I love chicken sandwiches. I didn't think much of I do. I enjoy chicken sandwiches. What's the most American thing that. Oh, the crossing of the street was kind of hard for me in the beginning, honestly looking the wrong way.  Yeah, I trying not to die in America. Yes. Very expensive to transport a body home. So yeah. That was just those, those kind of things that I was going through. But I honestly, it's very hard to come into a new country as a person who's on the other side. I had a lot of culture shock, a lot of culture shock, but there's a lot of learning as well.  So, I mean, what do I do? I haven't hiked I haven't done I haven't done the normal touristy things. I haven't gone to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. So, you know, I'm taking it slow.  Oh, I love it. So what you need to do is I'll give you a few tips for L.A. what you need to do, you need to get like a really nice dog and then you need to go for a hike, but then you need to dress as if you didn't care. But you have to dress as if you're on a runway and then you go for the hike and then make sure you don't sweat, but make it look like you were working.  Exactly. And I have a bottle of water as well. But it must be like a like a like a special type of bottle. It must be a bottle that says something about you as a person. Very natural but not too natural. And then. Yeah. And then and then just enjoy yourself but don't be yourself. Just be who you who you think you should be and you'll have a good time for me.  I don't think I can be able to do it and I don't know.  Can I tell you that. No, but can I tell you the thing for real though, is that's the great thing about what you're doing. What a lot of people do is you are you and people are loving you for that. I think that's why you're successful in the movie. You play the character fantastically. And I think when people meet the real gnomes in real life, they go like, wow, she's even more of a princess in real life.  So I think you're gonna experience more success, more joy, and you have no risk of somebody taking away that passport. Thank you so much for joining me on the show. So thank God I can't wait to see you when the lockdown ends.  Yes, yes, yes. Please stay safe. OK? All right. And we're so proud of you.  So yes, of course. Yes. Thanks to have a bye.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the beginning of a Trevor Noah podcast about The GameStop Uprising."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're listening to Comedy Central now. Hi, this is Bill Clinton. Please join me on my podcast. Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this for conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know? We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future. Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  My name is Rita Kaye. I am Ellen Bernstein Brodsky. This is your grandmother. What's the matter with you?  Well, and it is a podcast about the relationship between grandmothers and grandchildren, as my mother would have said, TACA, who wouldn't have wanted a Jewish grandmother?  Sometimes she accidentally live streams. We're like, who's going to tell her?  I'm just hearing about this now. Let's you to call your grandmother on the, I hope, radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  The stock markets, America's number one supplier of great depressions, as volatile as the stock market can be. This has been one of its wildest weeks yet craziest business story out there.  And Internet trading mob is driving GameStop shares higher, it appears, despite short sellers. Look at the stock. It's up more than six hundred eighty percent so far this year.  They realized that all of the institutional investors were hedging on GameStop. So they just bought a bunch of call options, bought a bunch of stock and created the a squeeze that you saw on Friday.  OK, OK. I don't know about you, but that explanation is way too complicated. Short selling the thing of the long selling and the look.  What we really need here is that scene from the Big Short where Margot Robbie breaks it down for us in the bathtub, you know, and I actually called her to do that, but she blocked my number. So I had to figure out plan B.  But basically there's a group of people on Reddit who don't use the stock market to invest. They use it to gamble. And yeah, that's what a lot of serious investors do to put these guys on Reddit a more honest about it. And they love to troll the people who aren't. So there's a store called GameStop that sells video games. Not a great business to be in. Such games can be downloaded now, which is why the serious investors decided to short GameStop, which means to bet against it.  But the creditors are gamers who have a semi ironic love for the store. So they started making names encouraging each other to punish the serious people by buying worthless GameStop stocks. Now, instead of failing, GameStop is succeeding wildly.  Not really. Of course not as a business. But come on, stocks are never real.  The serious people have already lost five billion dollars and some giant hedge funds have gone bankrupt.  Got it. Good.  Now let's get out Mogel Robi's bathroom before she gets home and asks me what I'm doing here. The last time she called me here was a bit awkward.  OK, now that we're on the same page, yo this shit is wild and I know some people are freaking out about this. People like this isn't how Wall Street is supposed to work. What's going to happen to these poor hedge funds?  Let me tell you something. Wall Street is going to be fine. All right? There are millions of people who are out of work and thousands of businesses closing. And yet the stock market is an all time high. No worried about hedge fund guys. They can cry about this from their helicopter that takes them to their boat. That takes them to their yachts.  In fact, if anything, I think it's actually funny to see how Wall Street doesn't like it when somebody's Wall Street to them. Yeah, because when they make moves that cost people their homes, people in Wall Street are like, hey, man, those are the rules. But when it happens to them, like, those aren't the rules.  The one going to regulate this and these Redit investors already moving beyond GameStop.  Now they're pumping up the stock prices of other failing companies like Bed, Bath and Beyond, AMC movie theaters and even Tootsie Rolls, which, by the way, I didn't even know that Tootsie Roll had its own stock. Who was that for? So it's a candy that looks and tastes like a turd, but it also sticks to your teeth. You're interested in investing. Now, if you think about it, the only reason that these Raddatz's have been able to pull this off is because of the Internet.  Yep. Think about it like Reddit and all these social media. They make it possible to get together with people who think like you. This wasn't possible decades ago. Like now, if you want to take down a hedge fund, you can find people to help you do it. If you want to plan an insurrection, you can find people to help you do it. So if you think you're the only person in the world who's attracted to that part of a stapler, that looks like a face.  Well, I'll see you at hot stapler faces dot com, my friend.  Mm mm mm. The GameStop stock explosion, you know, it's the reason your 14 year old cousin just bought a Ferrari, traders on Reddit sent the stock soaring this week, causing billions in losses for the hedge funds that bet against the video game retailer's stock. And today, Wall Street decided enough was enough. And this is a Fox News alert.  Now draw your attention to Main Street, where GameStop and AMC shares have been tumbling and trading action today as a growing number of firms move to halt trading on some stocks boosted by amateur traders on Reddit. The action is so wild that TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have restricted trading of these stocks. Wells Fargo also banning its advisors from telling clients to buy or sell GameStop and AMC.  Now, the criticism centered on Robert for abandoning their followers here in favor of helping those who had shorted all these stocks in the first place.  I don't particularly like the move on Robin Hood today. I'm talking to people this morning that say, OK, that is anticapitalism, you can't do that. A class action complaint was just filed in the southern district of New York against Robin Hood. And this is what part of it says, and I'm quoting purposefully, willfully and knowingly, Robin Hood, remove the stock GME GameStop from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise. Thereby it goes on manipulating the open market.  Yeah, that's right, people. Wall Street was getting rocked so hard by average people buying stock in GameStop that they just stopped average people from buying it. Yeah, the same guys, the same guys who are always like the markets must never be regulated. They must always remain free.  Those same guys are now like, oh, shit, the poor people got a hold of the freedom to turn it off, turn off the freedom.  So thanks to this ban, the GameStop stock that a lot of people bought for a ton of money is now worth a lot less, which is probably familiar to anyone who sold a used game back to GameStop. So right now, a lot of people are understandably upset about what Wall Street is doing.  In fact, it's bringing together people from all sides.  I mean, Ailsa and Ted Cruz are as far apart as Madison and Austin, and even they're both blasting the Robinhood app for blocking users from buying GameStop stocks. Everyone's mad. Even people like Yahoo! Jaru who tweeted, Yo, this is a good grab. What Robin Hood is doing, do not sell. And let me tell you something. When the guy who did the fire festival thinks that you're a fraud man and you're doing some shady shit.  Last week, you probably remember day traders on read it shocked the markets by driving stocks in GameStop, an AMC movie theaters higher than the Queen's here in Britain. But now Reddit has its eye on something even more shiny.  The GameStop saga continues to grow. It's not just stocks anymore, though. Reddit users are buying up silver, pushing up the value of the precious metal. Silver has now hit a five month high at nearly 30 bucks an ounce. That Redit group says that they're doing it because big banks, specifically JP Morgan Chase, have been, quote, suppressing metals for a long time.  Over the weekend, retail sites that sell silver coins and silver bars said that they were getting hit by unprecedented demand and they couldn't meet the demand.  It's been incredible. Pretty much physical silver. It's almost all gone in terms of life inventory.  We typically have about a thousand silver products in inventory available for purchase. We're getting so cleaned out right now that we're actually, last I checked, down to about 80 items in stock, which is a number I've never seen before and never thought we would ever see. The entire industry is frankly wiped out in terms of actually finding live silver that you can purchase and receive today. It's becoming impossible.  Oh, haemorrhaged Chaitanya. Oh, that's right, people.  Now, silver prices are skyrocketing, which is going to cause confusion at the next Olympics. I mean, if silver is more valuable than gold, everyone's going to try and get second place.  Sprinters will be at the finish line like after you met FDR, but after, you know, you always going first. But I'm always going first. You go ahead of me. Why don't you go ahead of me and this time you can go first.  Right now, while some Reddit users say that driving silver prices higher will cripple banks like JP Morgan, others claim that this movement is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms because it would help the banks. And I believe this because, of course, Wall Street will do that when Wall Street sees a scam going, it doesn't try to stop it. It tries to join in. If Wall Street caught you, robbing its mom would be like, hey, hey, I don't want to take off our shoes.  Sometimes she has cash in there. Get in there. Let me get in there with.  It's coordinated by the banks themselves a lot. The fact is the credit surge is now spreading from game stock to silver to all sorts of stocks.  And one of our correspondents has a pitch for where it should go next. Are you a creditor looking to stick it to the hedge funds? Well, forget about GameStop and Silver.  You got to invest in Kiwi's. I'm delighted. And Kiwis are the investment opportunity that Wall Street doesn't want you to know about their portable. They hold their intrinsic value. And it's easy to think you're ordering ten from Amazon and miraculously wind up with ten crates.  Here's a fact. As far as we know, every single hedge fund is shorting Kiwis. And are we going to let them do that to America's national fruit? I don't think so. But if we all buy Kiwis, then rocket ship and Kiwis are more than an investment.  They go great in fruit salads. They can be organic, track nuts, and they're the only fruit covered in fur. So if you ever wonder what it's like to take a bite out of a hamster, now you can with Kiwis.  And the best part is you don't even have to go through those Wall Street fat cats to get your Kiwi's, just call me and let me know how many you want, whether five or five thousand.  But this opportunity will not last forever.  Got maybe two days tops before it smells so bad in here that my landlord kicks me out. So order now. And remember, the more Kiwis we all buy, the more the hedge funds suffer.  It's just economics. So called today.  Please, honey, what did you do? I'm handling it.  Doug Henwood, welcome to the daily social distancing show here. Good to be here. From a distance. Yes. Yes, indeed. And it's it's a perfect time for you to be happy. You have really established yourself as somebody who is not just aware of the market and participates in the market, but also calls Wall Street out for what it really is. The biggest story right now is GameStop, Wall Street hedge funds and just a lot of money that is no way and yet everywhere in the shortest way possible.  How would you break this down to somebody who had no idea what was going on?  Most people, most civilians who don't really know the markets very well have the sense that it's all a big racket, kind of ludicrous, not that different from the casino, like all this image that Wall Street likes to cultivate about itself, that it's rational and it's at allocating capital efficiency and all that efficiently and all that. It's just nonsense. It's not doing any of those things. It does a little of it. But mostly it's just a game to try to outwit your competitors and people on the other side of a trade, whatever, and run away with the most money.  It's just there's nothing terribly rational. It's driven by emotions and psychology and fear. And most recently, over the last year or so, by a gusher of something like three trillion dollars in Federal Reserve money, which is been power, the market. So it's that sense that a lot of people have that this is all a bit of a racket is completely accurate.  So it seems like like you're saying, it's like basically people came into the casino and said, we're going to play against the house and we're going to make a lot of money. What's interesting here is a market that is oftentimes termed free and capitalistic has now been stopped. Can you explain that element? Why why was why was it stopped? Have these people broken the rules? Have they have they done anything wrong?  Well, I think there are a couple of things going on. One is these predators, they're just the wrong kind of people, but they're playing the same game that Wall Street does and they're getting together, talking up a stock, talking down a stock, trying to figure out the other guy's positions, looking who's weak, attacking them. They do Wall Street professionals do that sort of thing all the time. And I think it's very funny to hear their professions of outrage that this is just not moral.  You know, it's not fair. It's like the markets are supposed to be, you know, on the up and up and these guys are not playing fair. That's just utter nonsense. They're just the wrong kind of people. But I think the other thing is. Yeah, are they just trying to protect their own?  And Robin Hood a little likes to present itself as the democratic institutions and democratic broker for the masses are going to overturn the Wall Street order.  It's deeply plugged into the Wall Street establishment. That's how they make their money. They feed their orders to establish brokers who then make money on those trades by taking a little a little bit of the price.  So I think they are trying to make the market, but they're also trying to keep the fences up, make sure the ruble can't crash the party.  So then two questions. One, what does this tell us about Wall Street and the market and to what do we do to improve this? Because it feels like an unfair system.  It is an unfair system. It's a deeply unfair system. And one of the things that make me suspicious about all this talk of democratizing the stock market is that the distribution of income and wealth is very undemocratic. And there's nothing that you can do about that, nothing that a trading platform can do to change any of that. I mean, the fundamentals of the society are not going to change because some people in red, it got to play in the stock market.  But what does it tell you about Wall Street? It is largely of little economic significance. The standard story is that the stock market exists to raise money for productive corporations, to invest in capital equipment, buildings, hire people, do R&D.  It does almost none of that. The market really is more about extracting value from companies.  For shareholders. It's it really is a machine for extracting value. For the top one percent of society, the ownership of stocks is extremely concentrated."}]}

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. One of the big rallying cries of the Black Lives Matter movement has been defund the police.  But what does that mean? Well, a city in Oregon has offered one vision for what it might look like. Roy Wood Jr. has more.  In twenty 20, thousands of people marched in the streets trying to defund the police, which sounds scary, but what does it actually mean?  This really is a an idea to entirely reimagine public safety and rethink how we do it.  It means taking money out of police budgets and using it to fund different types of workers who handle some nine one one calls, kind of like how Batman had to take a pay cut to fund the Justice League. And in Eugene, Oregon, they're giving it a trial run with a program called Kahootz. Good. What is it like? A Crime Solving Owl is an acronym. It stands for Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Street. OK, so no, I sit down with Kahootz coordinators Tim Black and Ebony Morgan to find out how the little test project has been going.  So I'm guessing you guys started Kahootz a few months ago when everybody was marching in the streets?  No, we've actually been around for more than 30 years.  Wait 30 years. When your organization was created, the fresh prince had left for Bel Air yet, OK, they've been doing this for a while.  But what exactly are they doing?  What type of nine one one calls do you all typically respond to as a Kahootz agent?  Is it Agent Kahuta Hooty?  We respond to non-criminal and nonviolent calls for service that come through the number one line in our area and we respond with a crisis worker and an EMT instead of law enforcement.  You say that guns the right no guns, no tasers, no pepper spray and gun and checks. And then just also a baseball bat.  Why is it that we assume it's going to take a weapon to get somebody up off of you?  I hear what you're saying to him. But like, even more cops got mace and they protect him. Build-A-Bear Workshop.  But where other law enforcement officers are utilizing more and more expensive military gear to loosen a little white vans actually save a ton of money compared to the local police's annual budget of ninety million.  Kahootz cost about two million, around two percent of the police budget.  But Kahootz respond to almost 20 percent of emergency calls. What is a typical Kahootz call look like?  It's really about meeting people where they are and helping them get to a space that may be a little safer than we started talking on the side of the road. And it's noisy and you're overwhelmed.  Let's just have a seat in the back of the van and then we'll talk about nothing but kidnap anybody, not if they expect speculators get anything. I do promise people snacks if they get in something. What kind of snacks you got granola bars, some water, whatever. We'll have clothes on the van, tents, sleeping bags.  I'm going just be honest. You had me a snacks. I'm a 40 year old man. I'll get a van for some snacks.  But besides the granola bars, they have one big secret weapon just being chill, using a technique they call de-escalation.  The escalation of the practice where you're encountering somebody who is escalated and you help them get to a desolated space or a little more calm.  So what's the deescalated version of pepper spray like Tabasco sauce?  You just flicked it in somebody that, oh, no, I need to be engaged. I show you that I really care about the things that you're saying and finding that way that we can work through this crisis together.  But lately, kahunas have been putting their lives on the line, responding to teret America's angriest, most dangerous demographic.  And we get a lot of calls that are placed to public safety with a certain outcome in mind.  This say racism to the safe place. All right.  We have a lot of people that, you know, we do encounter situations where. Folks are calling in, you know, because of racist motivations or, you know, because they have a bias against different socioeconomic circumstances and in those situations, I think there are two things that we need to do.  One is we need to recognize what it was that triggered that person to make that call and that if they're going to slap the shit out of them or, you know, maybe try and present an opportunity for them to confront a little bit of their white fragility, a little bit of their explicit bias, I was going to say that next.  But then also at the other end with the individual that we are called out to respond to, you know, we have an obligation to say, hey, like this, this was unfair. We know that you didn't ask us to be here. We're here now. Is there anything that we can do for you?  So essentially, Karen calls now on one for protection from the homeless person and then y'all pull up and protect the homeless person from care, basically, and then all from Snax, that Kahootz is out there helping the homeless and in Cairns.  But I had to see it in action in a coveted safe way, of course, without leaving my home. You are the cops.  Technically, I can't get a hold of the police, but I would only do so if somebody was unsafe. And I'm not necessarily seeing someone say I'm safe right now.  I was so scared that Martin Luther King Jr. statue across the street has been staring at me. Can I say something to it, please?  Well, maybe I'm here to talk with you right now, though. And how long has this been going on for you?  Every day. Every day I come down the street and it's just a black guy and he's just staring at me. Where are the cops? Wish your gun was all of his stuff.  I don't see a threat. The immediate situation. Do you feel like that? You don't right now. I bet you don't. I bet you know him.  You people. What if he walks down a different block? What if you put the statue in a different place?  OK, we're not in charge of statue placement, but I am here to help you have a better day. And if this is going to ruin your day, you don't have to look at it.  Wow, these guys are good. And if Kahootz could do all of this with two million dollars, imagine what they could do with 90.  Incredible.  Thank you so much for that, Roy. When we come back, former NFL star turned actor Nnamdi Asomugha is joining me on the show to talk about his new movie on prime video.  Stick around. Lancaster, South Carolina, is in the middle of not much, but growing up nearby. I knew it as the hometown of a black man named Jim Duncan, who became a Super Bowl hero after the 15th. And now my new podcasts return man.  I'll discover that his death still makes no sense at all. The story was that my brother went to the police station, took a gun off a police officer and shot himself in the head. Most people don't believe that. For the past three years at the Rock Herald, I looked back at a story that's timelier than ever breaking down. So have you got some time to talk?  It involves race, the mental state of the person and a child that was scared to death.  The safe return man coming January 26 on the I Heart radio at Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast. If you took away the date and time, could you imagine that happening today? Yes, you can. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Nnamdi Asomugha. He's one of the best defensive players ever to play in the NFL, and now he's crushing it in a new career as an actor and producer. We talked about his new film and so much more.  Nnamdi Asomugha, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you for having me.  The last time I saw you was in person in the studio. I have not seen you since I would see you. Sometimes at events you would be the arm candy on your wife, Kerry Washington's. How are you how are you coping with this pandemic?  Yeah, these are the events that I would see that I would go as the support more than I've always the support at those events. But we're doing fine. It's a year into it now, almost. So the new normal is in. I think we're sort of rolling with the punches at this point. Right.  I feel I feel like though everyone's finding their few, you know, just just moments of joy, like I know I do that I. I wait for sporting events. I wait for special events. I wait for a movie to be released. That's why I get so excited whenever a new movie comes out, because we just we don't get to watch movies anymore. We don't get to go and have dinner. We don't get to live as much life.  And so before we get into your own movie that's on Amazon Prime, which is getting rave reviews, I wanted to talk to you about the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  You know, Tom Brady up against Patrick Mahomes is like the young versus the old, like the one of the greatest of all time, if not the greatest up against a future greatest possibly. Where's your money?  Oh, that's the question that yeah. I want to make it interesting.  I thought we were going into strategy and like, no, I just want to know, where's your money first? Where's your money?  I mean, I don't know how at age forty three you could ever bet against Tom at this point. It's like every time I mean there's always a point midway through the season where every single person that's talking about Tom Brady says he's done something for the last ten years that's always happened. And then he ends up in a Super Bowl at the end. So I don't know how you bet against him.  Let's talk about your second career, though. You know, not many people can, I think, move as effortlessly as you have from the world of sports at the highest level to the world of acting at the highest level on Broadway. People were blown away by your performance, you know, and then when you moved in front of the camera, people were amazed at how you just you just seem to effortlessly, effortlessly move from one script to the next from one roll to the next.  All these love is no different. You start opposite Tessa Thompson and a love story for the ages in a time where we're not used to seeing black leads together, you know, when it's not a story about oppression or slavery or or civil rights, it's a story about love. Yeah. What do you think has been the biggest reason for your success in this in this world? How have you managed to be that vulnerable coming from like the NFL?  Thank you for all of it and thank you for calling it success, because in my head, it's it's just always a work. So you never really know where you are. You just know that you have to keep going. But I don't know. I think I've realized that I'm a risk taker and I say because I just happen to love things that I'm not going into it saying I can't wait to take this risk. I just happen to love things that require me to take a risk in order to achieve them.  But I don't know. I think it's important to have no idea what you're doing and just go for it anyway. A lot of times in life, I think there's a beauty in that level of risk, I think at the end of the day. You're either going to succeed or you're going to grow, and I think both of those are a win, so why not go after it? And so that's what I've done. And and luckily, it's it's been working out and I've been able to sort of build from that.  It seems like in some ways your character has some of those those traits, you know, because you play a character who's a jazz saxophonist who's coming up trying to get his career off the ground. You know, you've got this woman who adores you and loves you and encourages you to be more. But she's doing her thing as well. It feels in many ways like the slivers of your life in this. And at the same time, you're playing a completely foreign, different character, first of all.  Is it true that you you spent a year learning how to play the saxophone before this role? I did. Yeah, I did. I mean. We had time, we took the script around town and we got passed on so often, but from time that we took it around was about a year and a half or so before we actually shot. I didn't know if that first group was going to say yes. So I needed to start playing the saxophone like they said no.  And it took a year and a half or so. But I just continued playing because you never really know what that moment is going to be when someone is going to say, yes, we'll make your movie. So I just kept playing and playing. I fell in love with it and fell in love with it. And I was able to then step on it and really not only play, but have fingering and everything down just so that it could it could be real.  Was that was there a point when you wondered if you now are just playing the saxophone for no reason because I mean, there's no guarantee the script will get picked up. There's no guarantee that a movie will get made. So now there you are, just like in the house. And at some point people are like, oh, you play the saxophone. In the beginning, you're like, yes, it's for my movie."}]}

This is the Daily Social Distancing Show. And today is February 2nd, also known as day two of Black History Month. So let's party people bust out some of that sweet black history music.  We do what we didn't know anyway on tonight's show.  Another reason you might not want to get on a plane. What Reddit learned from watching Wall Street and Biden. Better have my money. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with Trevor Noah. Here's a. Before we get started, today is Groundhog Day, which leads me to ask, what the hell is Groundhog Day?  People put a rodents out of the ground and then ask the animal to predict the weather. Really, this is so unfair, because if Africans were doing shit like this and you heard that we pulled animals out of the ground, like there are villages in Africa where people wear animal skin. And if I try to explain to them that Americans use groundhogs to predict the weather, they'd be like, but why not use satellite data? But let's move on from talking animals to e-mailing vegetables.  It sounds too crazy to believe scientists really have taught spinach to send emails.  All right, here's how it works. Just break it down to engineers at MIT report that spinach roots can detect a compound found in explosives like landmines. When the roots detect the compound, molecules in the roots release a signal. That signal is then read by an infrared camera, which sends an email alert to scientists. The purpose of the experiment is to detect explosives, but scientists believe it could be used to warn researchers of pollution. The experiment is part of a wider field of research that involves engineering electronic systems in the plants.  It is also called Plant Nano Bionics.  All right. I'm sorry, guys. This is insane. I mean, who emails anymore? Just DM me spinach. Seriously, spinach, DM me.  But you also know what this means. If spinach just got on e mail, it means that they're not as savvy about it as everyone else. So let me be the first to say Gretchen's my dearest friend, Spinach. I have a million dollars in interest that I suddenly cannot access until the deal much. If you are able to allow me to a thousand dollars, I will pay you back 15 times over. Please, spinach, I need you. And now we play the waiting game.  But Congressman, congratulations to the scientists who are working on this breakthrough. And now that they've told spinach how to send them email, maybe they can move on to the next scientific frontier. Teaching your mom how to use face time.  How do I turn the camera?  Mom, I've got to go. Just ask the spinach. Moving on to the coronavirus pandemic.  It's the reason sweatpants on our business expense. Yesterday, Western Australia went into total lockdown after discovering its first coronavirus case in 10 months. You see, Australia is very different from the United States in the US. Water goes down the drain clockwise and in Australia they care about stopping coronavirus. Now, part of the reason for Australia's success is that Australians don't resist the government as much when they tell them that they should stay at home. And it's partly because these people know that covid is a serious disease.  It's also partly because it lets Australians stay away from all the other things in Australia that could kill them. And it's bad enough that the scorpions and snakes are trying to kill me. But there's a koala that's trying to get me an ashtray. Now, eventually, of course, the world will reemerge from the pandemic.  And I know everyone thinks that they're going to jump right back into their old lives, you know, like going to bars or theatres or using the bottom half of your face to express emotion. But you might want to prepare for a period of adjustment because some things apparently take a little time to relearn.  A new report says some pilots are getting rusty on the job due to the pandemic because, well, there are fewer planes to fly. Some pilots grounded for months by the pandemic have seen the skills and proficiency suffer. For instance, one pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake, damaging a tow truck that was trying to pull that plane from the gate. In another case, the pilot, while forgot to turn on the anti icing mechanism. Other reports include lining up the wrong runway for landing.  To counter such rustiness, the FAA stops pilots from flying a commercial jet unless they have performed at least three takeoffs and three landings, either on a plane or in a simulator in the previous 90 days.  I don't know about you, but this is kind of scary. Apparently, you never forget how to ride a bike, but you forget how to fly a plane after like five days. Oh, man, this is going to change everything. Next time the plane hits turbulence, the pilot's going to jump on the intercom like, are there any hijackers on board?  We need someone who knows how to fly the plane. Harpreet, any hijackers, please make yourself known to the cabin crew.  And listen, I get that pilots are human and everyone makes mistakes at their jobs, but there are certain jobs where there is way less room for error. You know, like as a mail carrier, you might say, oh, whoops, this package was supposed to go to apartment two and accidentally sent it to apartment three. But as a pilot, it's more like a whoopsies. These people were supposed to go to Miami and I accidentally sent them to heaven and trust me now, this is not just going to be pilots, people, everyone is going to be rusty off to covid projectionists are going to be showing movies upside down.  Bouncers are going to be letting in groups of ugly dudes and telling beautiful women they got on the wrong shoes. Bullies are going to give you their lunch money. Meanwhile, until the pandemic is actually over, Americans are going to need more help getting through it. And the big question of what that help will look like is dominating Washington, D.C. right now.  President Biden's pledge of bipartisanship facing its first test tonight. The president inviting 10 Republican senators to the Oval Office to pitch their covid relief counteroffer. Their six hundred billion dollar proposal is a mere fraction of the president's one point nine trillion dollar package. The GOP plan leaves out a minimum wage boost. The president includes and whittles down his fourteen hundred dollar direct payments to Americans to one thousand dollars.  Still, when all was said and done. The White House did not appear to be conceding much ground, saying the president will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.  This is a sign of this effort from President Biden to get bipartisanship here. But it also comes as Democrats on Capitol Hill are paving the way to move forward with only Democratic votes for this relief package.  Look, man, I'm not going to lie. I get why Democrats and Republicans are having trouble agreeing on this relief package. I mean, this is a difference of one point three trillion dollars. How do you compromise when you're that far apart? It's like deciding what you want to get for dinner and you want something nice, but your date wants to eat out of a gas station, trash can. You can't compromise and eat out of a nice trash can.  But I also do love how Republicans suddenly get stingy the second that a Democrat comes into office, because don't forget, during the Trump years, they were handing out tax cuts with a strip of money gun. But now that Biden is president, suddenly they're trying to hand out covid relief a penny at a time, one penny to OpenEdge. Am I making it rain yet? Three pennies? Yes. More of a drizzle. I agree. Now, a lot of people are upset about the Democrats plan to give people fourteen hundred dollars because they say that the Democrats promised to give people two thousand dollars.  But the Democrats are arguing that everybody already got the first six hundred a month ago. And I get the Democrats point on this one. But at the same time, so many people are struggling right now. Why not just give them twenty six hundred instead? I mean, you can find the money somewhere. Just take it from spaceports. Trump is gone. We don't have to pretend that that's a thing anymore. And finally, let's move on to the second.  Most talked about Instagram video from last night's Ofter Courtside Karen The Post by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who gave a harrowing account of her personal experience during the capital attack.  We're getting an eye opening new look inside last month's siege on the US Capitol. Ocasio Cortez describing the impact of the riots, sharing details about what happened to her during the insurrection at the Capitol, telling her viewers she felt like she was going to die.  All of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on my door like this, like I'm here. And the bathroom door starts going like this, like the bathroom door is behind me or rather in front of me. And I'm like this. And the door hinges right here.  And I just hear, where is she? Where is she?  And this was the moment where. I thought everything was over, you know, I just happened to. You know, be a spiritual person and be raised in that context, and I really just felt like, you know. If this is the plan for me. Then people will be able to take it from here. Wow. You know, for a lot of us at home, the capital riots were basically an action movie on TV. I mean, it was scary, intense and terrifying, but at the end of the day, we were just watching it.  But an action movie is very different when you are actually in the movie. I mean, AOC and other members of Congress literally thought that they were going to die on a Wednesday afternoon, no less. I mean, nobody should die in the middle of the week. That means you went to work on Monday and Tuesday for nothing. And thank God that no members of Congress were actually hurt. But even just believing that you're going to die is a major trauma.  And ABC handled it way better than I would have. I mean, she was like, if this is where my journey ends, so be it. If I thought about it, I wouldn't be pondering my journey. I'd be trying to delete my browser history. And to everyone out there who's saying, oh, how scared could she really have been? How scared could she have been? Think about how terrified you get when someone knocks on the bathroom door when there isn't even a riot.  So once you hear, oh, God, no, they're going to know that I poop. So I'm glad that ABC shed the story because many Republicans in Congress would like to just pretend that this shit never happened, that the lives of Congress members and their staff weren't in danger, and that police officers guarding the Capitol weren't injured and killed. But if there's no accountability, then it becomes easier and easier for it to happen again. And the last thing we need from this action movie is a sequel.  Right. When we come back, we'll look at why hedge funds are so mad about the GameStop uprising. And Ibrahim Scandi is joining us on the show.  So don't go away. I've got one word for you, Tom Cruise, on this new weekly podcast meeting, Tom Cruise, we're going to talk about Tom Cruise. We're going to talk to people who have met Tom Cruise. Why? Because Tom Cruise is the greatest movie star of all time. Is he, though? Shut your mouth. Everyone who has met him has an amazing story to tell. And that's where he met Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise.  When I hear the bathroom door open and it's Tom Cruise. Hey, everybody, I'm Jeff Meacham. You might know me as Josh Open Hole from TV's Blackfish. And I'm here with the ghost of my maverick. Hey, I'm Joel Johnston. You might know me as Archie and the marvelous Mrs.. And I'm Alec Lev. And you know, no one knows you from anything. Listen, we love Tom Cruise. We are inspired by Tom Cruise. But while we live and work in Hollywood, we've never actually met Tom Cruise.  So we're going to talk to some people who have and maybe one of them will lead us to the man himself so we can have our own. Of meeting Tom Cruise does really have to, Jessica, about Tom Cruise. What are you here? Listen to meeting Tom Cruise on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.  Hi, this is Bill Clinton.  Please join me on my podcast. Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this for conversations with some of the most fascinating people I know. We'll talk about ideas that deserve more attention, about how science, technology and design are improving our lives, and about why we should be hopeful and optimistic about our future. Listen to why am I telling you this on the radio Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  Welcome back to the daily social distancing show. By now, you've probably heard about the GameStop uprising, the biggest thing to happen with video games since Sonic got busted for doping. But if you haven't heard the news, what happened was that some Wall Street hedge funds bets a lot of money that the stock price of the video game store GameStop would fall. But a bunch of people on Reddit found out about those bets. So they started buying GameStop shares so that the price would go up and the hedge funds would lose a lot of money and lose a lot of money they did in the billions of dollars.  So as you can imagine, Wall Street is pretty unhappy with those Reddit investors.  A handful of industry leaders are calling for an investigation because of the angry mob that's formed against them.  Last week was a free market. It was a free for all market, no doubt about it.  For my twenty five years in the business, I've never seen this form of collusion on such a widespread fashion. This type of behavior is not the behavior that you want to be replicating. I think there is something obviously wrong, and it's the gamification of Wall Street.  Talk to an analyst this morning, guys. He said this is dangerous. They forget they're buying a stock in a piece of a company. It's not just some symbol that you play hot potato with it.  Just because you throw the Hail Mary pass in your back yard and it's caught for the touchdown in the wind. Doesn't mean you're Tom Brady.  What's going through my mind is how irrelevant I feel and how every day I just don't want to get out of bed and how it's the least amount of fun I think I've ever had. Oh, man.  These Wall Street guys are taking this so hard that the interviews are just turning into therapy sessions.  I feel so irrelevant right now and I'm not having any fun. And I just remembered my parents never hung my paintings on the refrigerator.  But the truth is, what the Rediscuss did here is nothing new. In fact, the only thing that makes this so unique is that this is just the first time that the little guy has used the big guys tactics against him, because when it comes to manipulating the market and treating trades like a game, no one is better at it than Wall Street. I mean, they do this shit all the time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me a section of a Trevor Noah podcast about AOC Recounts Capitol Riot Attack | Ibram X. Kendi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, let's take a look at a few examples, starting with a scam one big bank pulled just a few years ago.  The New York Times reporting over the weekend that Goldman Sachs is running a scheme to artificially inflate aluminum prices.  An aluminum warehouse controlled by Goldman Sachs holds the equivalent of a quarter of the annual North American demand for the metal, but only offloads or distributes a required minimum of three thousand tons a day. No more, no less. Whatever the demand, pushing prices of the metal higher even as demand has declined. Goldman profits from this practice two ways.  First, from the extended rents paid to store the metal, and second, by the bets made on aluminum futures by its trading arm.  The inflated aluminum pricing by Goldman and other financial players has cost American consumers five billion dollars over the last four years.  Yeah, that's right. Basically, Goldman Sachs manipulated the supply of aluminum by only letting out a little bit at a time. You know, the same way Daniel Day Lewis limits the supply of movies, isn't it? I mean, the dude's only been in six movies over the past twenty years. The Rock made that many movies yesterday. Get to work.  Danny, by the way, for the rest of the segment, I'm going to be pronouncing its aluminum, even though the correct pronunciation is aluminium. But we had a vote and all the people I work with our American. And so they won. And I didn't want to accept the election result. But then I was like, no, we don't want to do that again. And I'm sorry, guys, but aluminum should never be hoarded. It needs to be used the way God intended to make condoms for robots or for major retail.  Green to wear is a hat. And believe it or not, Goldman Sachs got away with the scheme for years until people caught onto it. So I guess you could say that their aluminum plan. Was foiled, wow, brown, brown, brown.  Now, as crazy as this is, it's actually a common tactic with Wall Street. You take over a market and then manipulated supply to drive up the price. Like how JP Morgan used its control over electricity to fleece California.  JPMorgan Chase accused of manipulating energy prices and so driving up the electric bills of millions of Americans that night when energy prices are very low, essentially, they would bid them up so that in the morning the companies would go to buy energy and find the prices artificially high, takes a few hours to get a power plant going. So they would have to buy the energy in the morning when it was very, very expensive. In one case, JPMorgan duped California utilities into paying nine hundred ninety nine dollars per megawatt hour when the going rate was only twelve dollars.  Yo, this shit is crazy. It's like these guys were sitting around a table like I'm tired of just abusing our power metaphorically. Let's do it for real. Basically, because of JPMorgan, the cost of electricity went up from twelve dollars per megawatt to almost a thousand dollars per megawatt. Even Amish people were like, Yo, I don't even know what electricity is, but that shit is messed up. I hope the Amish community doesn't come off to me on Twitter for that one.  I mean, at that price, I would actually be less upset if you jumped me and robbed me. At least then it feels like you had to work for it. And the truth is, this isn't something hedge fund people are ashamed of. In fact, some of them even brag about it on the TV.  Jim Cramer once made a fortune running a successful hedge fund. He went on to host his own TV show, Mad Money, that offers stock tips to investors. But as Cramer has found out lately, a lot of Americans are mad at him. This video, made in 2006, has suddenly gone viral. Cramer explains to his own financial website, The Street Dotcom, how he could influence stock prices up and down as the manager of a massive hedge fund.  You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money, but it's a fun game and it's a lucrative game. And I would encourage anyone who's in the hedge fund to do it because it's legal and it is a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. But by the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that.  But I didn't care. These people got no shame, no shame. Zero, nada, zilch. He's just out here boasting about his evil plans. I mean, the only people who do that are hedge fund guys and bond villains. I mean, listen to him, listen to him talk about it. It's legal and it's very satisfying. Just as a general rule, whenever you have to remind someone that something is legal, it's probably shady.  You know, no one's ever like, hey, Trevor, you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory? It's legal. But when it comes to hurting people in order to make a buck, nothing compares to the Great Recession of 2008, which was caused by guess who?  Wall Street manipulating the markets during the hot housing market, banks took millions of home mortgages, many held by people who could not afford them and bundled them into packages as mortgage securities. JPMorgan today admitted that it sold those packages to investors, even though its executives knew that many of the mortgages were highly suspect. When the market collapsed, those packages became mostly worthless.  Goldman sold investors subprime mortgage packages, but then made its own bet those same investments would lose value without telling investors. Goldman employees themselves use profanity to disparage the deals.  Boy, that Timberwolf was one deal.  And when asked if any of the executives at least felt partly responsible for the financial collapse, there's things that we wish we could have done better in hindsight or even regret.  Regret, to me means something that you feel like you did wrong. And I don't have that.  When you hear your own employees or read about those in the emails, do you feel anything? I feel I think that's very unfortunate to have on e-mail. Are you and and very unfortunate. I don't get emails and please don't take that feeling that way. I think it's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that.  God damn, even the crowd, do you see them? Even the crowd in the chamber was like, oh, you know how bad you have to screw things up to turn a Senate hearing into a Jerry Springer taping. But this is how you know, how psychotic these guys are. Not only did they tank the economy, but they talk about emotions like they're serial killers. Do you regret hurting these people? Regret is a thing that one feels when one has done something wrong.  I mean, how can you expect these guys to change their behavior when they can't even express their remorse the closest? Wall Street comes to reflecting is doing Coke off of a mirror. So after all the damage Wall Street has done to people's lives, please miss me with all of this whining about how unfair it is for Redit to boost GameStop. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all these guys are heroes, but I will say it has been fun watching how some of the people who got rich off of GameStop have been spending their money.  While GameStop has mentored plenty of millionaires, many retail investors are using their more modest profits to pay bills.  One Reddit user even posting that he paid off his student loan debt thanks to the money he's made off of GameStop the last few days.  Ten year old Jaden Carr. Two years ago, his mom bought him 10 shares of GameStop as a Kwanzaa gift. Back then, they were six dollars each. Now he sold them for more than three thousand dollars. What are you going to do with the money that you've made on GameStop?  I am already saying the rest.  The the of the company Hunter Con cashed in on the GameStop phenomenon last week, but didn't just cash in for himself. He used some of the money he made to donate six Nintendo switches and games to the children's hospital in Minnesota.  One day trader who cashed in on the craze walked into a GameStop store this week and started handing out hundred dollar bills to employees.  After the Robinhood app halted trading on GameStop, one investor chartered a plane to fly a banner over the company's headquarters saying, Suck my nuts, Robinhood.  Oh, that's a gangsta move right there. It's like Twitter, but in the sky now, you could say it's childish to spend money you took from Wall Street to dunk on Wall Street. And that may be. But in the words of Jim Cramer, it's legal and very satisfying. All right. When we come back, Ibrahim Candy will talk about African-American history that you might have missed. Hey, all with that, it's just hilarious and I'm just making sure y'all know that I got a book, it's called Carefully Reckless on the Black Effect Network.  I'm going to be telling you all my business and some of your other people's business, too. And ain't no limits to the things that talk about, you know, that if y'all know me from baby mama drama to healthy relationships, from child support to stimulus checks, look, will you take a step back and you realize that we all go through crazy stuff and we got stories to tell. Those situations do not define you, but they do make for real good conversation in the world with click bait and cancel calls.  You can tell your story before you do. I'm creating the outlet to remind people that we still human crazy and we can all laugh about it. Don't stress over it. Bring your problems to me. I promise I won't judge you. But am I crack a joke to you?  Don't be scared. It'll be respectful and messy at the same time. Just make sure you tune in. Listen to Carefully Reckless every Wednesday on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcast.  Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Professor Ibrahim Scandi. He's a historian who you might know from his award winning book, How to Be an Anti-racist. We talked about his new anthology of African-American history and so much more. Professor Kennedy, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  It's great to be back on the show. Yeah, it's good to be back for you. But technically, the last time I saw you was in the studio and a lot has changed since then. I mean, not just the fact that people at home, but the fact that America has seen so many changes.  And yet some may argue America has seen so much more of the same. Your book goes to The New York Times best sellers list during the protests. And what many people gravitated to in your work was how you laid steps out for people to engage in anti-racism. Tell me a little bit more about that and firstly, why you felt it was necessary to lay out the steps and the tools that people could use and why it's so important to be anti-racist as opposed to just not being racist when racial inequity and injustice is normal.  If you do nothing, what's going to happen to that normality? It's going to persist. And so I really wanted to encourage people to actively challenge racism, but also to to realize there's a direct opposite to notions of racial hierarchy, and that's notions of racial equality, which are anti-racist ideas. There's a direct opposite to policies that lead to maintain racial inequity, and that's anti-racist policy. So so we can be creating a different type of America with different types of policies and different type of ideas.  A lot of people love your work because you delve into the past and you tie it to the present. This project is really special.  Because you are editing a book about the history of being African-American. And yet, instead of just looking at it through the lens of one person, one author, one story teller, you've gone with multiple stories, just everyone from every walk of life who fought for black freedom in America, from the slave trade all the way through to the current day. Tell me why you thought you could really tell a story that has been told so many times in a different way.  Why do you think I'll jump on this project to edit this book?  Well, I mean, with the four hundredth anniversary or birthday of a black America approaching. I think we wanted to figure out a new way to tell. Black, black, America's history, we wanted a new way to commemorate this moment, and one of the oldest racist ideas is this idea that we're a monolith, that that there is not incredible diversity within black America. And also African-American history has traditionally been written by a man, oftentimes a black man.  And so I think with those two things, we really wanted to bring together a community to write the history of a community, an extremely diverse community. And I think that's one of the things we're most proud about in terms of this book, just the diversity of blackness within the book and even the ordinary and extraordinary characters we share.  When you look at those stories, do you ever wonder what your dream is for the end goal? Sometimes I'll be talking to friends who will say, what is your definition of white privilege? And I say, just for me personally, I go for me, white privilege is you have the opportunity to fail on your behalf and succeed on your behalf and your behalf alone. Know if a white man launches a rocket to the moon. That's what he did know.  If a white man shoots up a school, that's what he did. If a black person launches a rocket to the moon, then I mean, these niggas be launching rockets, you know what I'm saying? And so I wonder what your idea is. As a professor who studies race, what do you what are you hoping that we get to? What place do you hope to see us achieve? Well, it's it's ironic you speak about that individuality, because I think in the introduction to 400 Souls, I wrote about how we're not able as black people to be individuals.  Right. And so certainly for me, that would be an end goal. But I also think, you know, justice you know, equal justice for all peoples. You know, just something as simple as when I see a member of public safety or a police officer or whatever we would have in the future. I don't feel scared, you know, when I haven't done anything wrong. I'm not going to to to certainly feel scared or something. Like I walk into a place to to apply for a job.  And I don't have to look twice at what I'm wearing and how I'm going to speak, because that's not really going to matter, especially if, you know, I have the qualifications.  I've always wondered, you know, when I traveled the world, I was you know, I've been lucky enough. My comedy would take me to different countries. I was always intrigued by how black people specifically would be treated differently when they were not the black of that country. You know, like black Americans would come to South Africa and oftentimes it was shopkeepers or just people in the street. They'd be like, oh, you're a black American. Very, very different.  And sometimes even Africans from other African countries would come and be treated differently. The same, I would notice, in America. Is that something in the story of race that is also tied to the history of how the country has treated the people of that race in the country?  I think so. I think race and racism is simultaneously global and national. In other words, you can see similar trends across the world.  But each of those trends, each of those policies and each of those racial constructions are distinct to the nation. But what's also consistent is pretty much every nation in the world argues that they're not racist towards.  Yeah, you see that across the board, whether it's the South African apartheid government or through to the US, no matter who it is, people go like, no, no, no, no, we're not racist. We just do these racist things to these people. There's there's a new administration in the White House."}]}

I'm Kate Berlin. I'm Jacqueline Novak. We're comedians, best friends and consumerist hogs hemorrhaging cash in the wellness world. That's why we made a podcast, PWG, with the Big Money Players Network and I heart radio. Though we suffer from no ailments. We are looking to heal for us, salvation lies in the next product, practice or potion. This is our hobby. This is our health. This is our naked desire for free products.  This is Googs. That's P g PWG on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts.  Well, hello, everybody, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show. I'm Trevor Noah. Today is Tuesday, the 1st of December. We made it to December, which means there's only 50 days left until Donald Trump leaves the White House and has to start doing his own laundry again. Anyway, coming up on tonight's show, Melania Saves Christmas Space. Aliens are stealing our ideas. And Rosie Perez joins me on the show. So let's do this, people.  Welcome to the daily social distancing show from Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Decency Show with terminal.  Right now, it feels like the only story that matters every day is the coronavirus.  It's taken over all of our news, all of our attention, you know, like like some sort of virus. But believe it or not, there is still a ton of other news going on in the world right now. So let's catch up on some of it in today's edition of Headlines.  Let's kick it off with Melania Trump, first lady of the United States and the only Trump family member who's already in prison, you might remember that the last time Melania made news, it was because an ex friend of hers leaked a recording of her, which made her sound a lot like a Slovenian Scrooge.  I'm working like a as far as I know, Christmas stuff that, you know, some of stuff. It's a crazy, but I need to do it right.  OK, I think we can all agree that is not a good look, especially in America. The only decorations Americans love more than Christmas with those candles that smell like desserts and those bowls of dry flowers that look like a snack, they are not a snack. So after that leaked recording came out, it was obviously important that this year Melania made it clear that she really, really does give a fuck about Christmas.  And it looks like she rose to the occasion and she may have less than two months to go in the White House.  But Melania Trump is decking the halls today. The first lady unveiled this year's White House Christmas decorations and she avoided any controversy with a traditionally festive look.  Just released video from first lady Melania shows the halls filled with festive decorations. The theme for her final holiday season at the White House is America the Beautiful. Each room has its own color scheme, and the Christmas trees are adorned with crafts made by children from all 50 states.  There are plenty of traditional style decorations of trees with white lights and red ornaments. There's also a village hospital to honor front line workers amid the pandemic.  Oh, they even have a little ornament hospital. Given how crowded the real hospitals are right now, that one better get ready to start taking tiny patients. But on the real, though, I think that's a beautiful tribute to health care providers. I mean, it is a little strange that the Christmas decorations acknowledge covid more than the administration has, but still it is something. But at the same time, I kind of feel bad for millennia. Yeah, because I think she was right in the first place.  No one cares that much about Christmas decorations.  And before you say, oh, you do. Yeah, yeah, you say that. But you have one tree. She has to decorate the entire White House.  If you had to decorate one hundred rooms, you'd also end up being like these Christmas stuff. But now, because she was busted, Melania has to be more Christmas than even Mariah Carey. Are you happy people now? It looks like Christmas total up all over my house. And you can tell this thing, Godchaux, because she definitely won more traditional this year with the decorations. I mean, remember twenty eighteen, those Christmas trees that she died with goat blood and twenty seventeen, that was even crazier.  She just spray painted. Santa is not real on the walls. That was, that was pretty out there. But let's move on from the Trump administration to another endangered species, sea turtles, because contrary to popular belief, being a turtle is not easy, my friends. I mean, yeah, that shell keeps predators out, but it also makes it hard to let anyone in. But luckily, this week, some of these little guys caught a little break.  Well, it's not only people who flock to Florida in cold weather. 40 sea turtles were flown to the Florida Keys from Cape Cod yesterday after suffering what's known as cold, stunning after they were exposed to frigid water for too long, the Kemp's Ridley sea turtles are considered a critically endangered species. A group of private pilots called turtles fly to donated their time, aircraft and fuel to help the cold blooded creatures recover. The turtles will be returned to the ocean in time for mating season.  Tell me that is not adorable. These turtles were freezing, but now because they're in Florida, they're nice and warm and they all have STDs. And did you see them getting put into that banana box to fly? Oh, they look like a little bunch of sperm airline customers, Spirit Airlines, even the turtles don't get enough legroom. I will say, though, this whole flying them somewhere else is going to make a lot of other animals jealous because it was probably a duck migrating that looked in the plane like, oh, hell no, I'm going to fly myself.  In fact, I'm a little jealous. I mean, I'm freezing my ass off, too, but nobody's flying me down to Florida for free.  I also want to go spread covered in the club.  I will say, though, this story really gives you an interesting insight into our society, because if a turtle gets flown down to warmer weather, they call that preservation. But if an Instagram model gets the same thing, she's called a ho double standard, much moving on from the ocean to the deserts.  And the big mystery that has everyone talking, the mystery of the silver monolith that seemed to appear out of nowhere in the Utah desert has deepened. It has now mysteriously disappeared. It's not known he removed it.  So do we think it's aliens? It's aliens, isn't it? Got to be if you weren't thinking that this was aliens, you may now I think it's aliens.  Yeah, if aliens are going to come down to earth, 20, 20 would be. You're right. This would be the one.  OK, people, I can't believe I have to say this, but clearly this is not aliens, right? This is somebody ripping off 2001 A Space Odyssey. Unless it is aliens and they're ripping off two thousand one, that will be really depressing.  Imagine if you found out that aliens just get all their ideas from watching our movies. You know, they're going to make contact with humans and be like I am next the wise and this is my way. But here's my question. Why are we so desperate to discover aliens, guys?  Hmm? Do you know much crazy shit is already down on earth, have you guys seen a platypus? We've seen a volcano. I mean, just look at this fish, look at this fish and tell me it doesn't look like an alien. That's about a torture. Princess Leia.  And now, your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base. And if this is supposed to be some abstract art, then you know what, it belongs in the desert. Keep that garbage out of sight. I'm tired of artists putting up random shit and then saying, oh, it's a comment on the human condition. No matter, it's a spoon. Save the space for art that actually speaks to the mysteries of life and nature.  Know like those dogs playing poker. What were they playing for? High stakes. I will say, though, it is really strange that this monolith just disappeared without a trace, because not where it's gone, we'll never know.  Where do you want us to put this giant flag thing? Yeah, you could put it in the bedroom, please. Thank you. We'll just never know. Moving on to the other global pandemic that just won't go away. Racism.  We all know how videos of police brutality have led to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement here in the United States.  But it turns out similar uprisings are happening all over the world, most recently in France.  French politicians are to rewrite part of a controversial security bill amid national outrage over a police assault on a black man. Evidence of the officers beating music producer Michel ZECHER in his Paris studio was captured on CCTV.  There have been several protests in Paris and other cities across the country against Article 24 of the bill, which will regulate how people should feel photos of police. Critics fear the new law could stop people exposing police brutality.  So it turns out France was about to possible that outlawed sharing videos of the police. But now that the police were caught on video beating an unarmed black man, they're going to try and rewrite that bill. So in a way that was very good timing on that beating, because imagine if it had happened after the law had passed, that guy would have been like, they beat me for being black or no. Do you have video? No, because it's illegal to have video to bed without the video.  It did not happen. You can see that. But we don't know without the video. But this just goes to show you whether it's America, France or Nigeria. The official government line is always that police brutality is not a problem. Then time and time again, we discover video evidence that shows otherwise. So it's really no surprise that the French government wanted to ban filming. I mean, it's easier to gaslight the public when there's no evidence to the contrary.  But that's exactly why the French need to be able to film their police so that they can prove this. And because France makes better police brutality videos, I mean, they've got artistic angles. You know, the black and white, the melancholy music, I it's very sophisticated.  And finally, we're now about one month away from the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. I know. Crazy, right?  It feels like it was just yesterday when we were punching grannies for toilet paper, but it'll still be at least six months before there's enough vaccine for everybody, which means the fight is now on to elbow your way to the front of the line.  Today, a CDC advisory panel is meeting to vote on recommendations about who will get the vaccines first once they're approved by the FDA, but only enough medicine for about 20 million people expected by the end of this year.  Authorities are having to prioritize. Already, health officials have said that seniors with underlying health conditions and doctors who treat covid patients should be put at the front of the line will ultimately be up to state and local officials to choose where the doses go first.  Oh, this is going to be the big drama of twenty twenty one. Who is going to get priority for the vaccine? Because, look, everyone agrees that the first groups who should get this vaccine should be the frontline health care workers. Right. Then should be people named Trevor, then seniors.  Very important to protect our seniors, then people named Trevor again. I mean, in case the first time didn't take. And then we protect those who have pre-existing, like, you know, the people. We just got to get the order. Right. And I know they're going to prioritize people based on risk and health.  But if you ask me, America has already figured out the best way to decide how to distribute rewards. And that's right. I'm talking about Vaccine Ninja Warrior.  Oh, yeah. Who wants to survive? All right.  We're going to take a quick break. But when we come back, Joe Biden is selecting his cabinet. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is fleecing his fans. Stay tuned to find out how.  You know exactly where you were when the Golden State killer was arrested, you still pay for cable to get Lifetime, your moderator on the Zodiac Killer celebrity.

Your cases are waiting for you. New episodes of Saul are available now on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts. One crime for suspects. Can you solve it? Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. For the past month, the two big stories in politics have been Joe Biden preparing to step into the presidency without breaking more bones and Donald Trump refusing to step down from the presidency because he insists on keeping the White House Hulu accounts.  So let's see where things stand in our somehow still ongoing coverage of vote chasm 20 20.  Let's begin with President elect Biden. America's control alt delete. He's been assembling his new administration and it looks like he's putting his best foot forward. Well, I guess he's only working foot, but it's still pretty impressive.  President elect Joe Biden is unveiling key members of his foreign policy and national security team today. The players are familiar from the Obama administration and notable for their diversity. If confirmed, Alejandro Mayorkas will be the first Latino and immigrant to serve as secretary of Homeland Security. Avril Haines will be the first female director of national intelligence. And Linda Thomas Greenfield, a career diplomat, is nominated to represent the United States at the U.N.. Mr. Biden also announced his new White House communications team.  It is a diverse all female group, including several mothers of young kids.  Now that is progressive and all women communications team and a national security team that is racially diverse. People all over the Middle East are going to be like, what an honor, what an honor to be bombed by such a WOAK administration and a communications team of all women will be a refreshing change. Because let's be honest, guys, men always lying about size to try and impress people. Don't be fooled. This team isn't as diverse as it seems on the surface.  For example, all of these people have experience in their fields. Everyone's experienced.  The Trump administration would never have tolerated this kind of discrimination against incompetence. Shame on you, Joe Biden. Shame on you. Meanwhile, on the other side of reality, Donald Trump's attempt to cling to office faced another setback yesterday when Wisconsin and Arizona became the latest states to formally certify Biden's victory. And the Arizona ceremony happened at a particularly awkward moment for Donald Trump.  As the governor was signing the certification documents, his cell phone buzzed with the ring tone of Hail to the Chief. Deucy has previously said he set that song for calls coming from the White House. This time, he muted the phone and set it aside as he signed documents that made Trump's loss official.  Who? That is called sending the president of the United States to voicemail like he's spam, which he is, but still, you know, Fox and Friends are watching this like, oh, that's a good trick.  We can just not answer the phone. We've got to try that. And you know, what made this move, especially gangster, is that he knew Trump was watching him on live TV. We've all had that moment where we think somebody is ignoring our call or our text.  But to actually see it, to see him, look at his phone, see your name, and then put it away.  Oh. That had to hurt Trump was probably sitting there like, this is so painful, I've got to call Melania and tell her how bad it hurts.  I guess millennials can come to the phone right now, and as upsetting as those losses are for Trump, it's even more frustrating for Trump supporters because they must be wondering how their guy can possibly still be losing, especially after they've donated tons of money for the legal battles against the rigged election."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me the end of a Trevor Noah podcast about Joe Biden's Inauguration | Stacey Abrams."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I also want to make sure that we think about all the other women of color and white women who have entered the space where they are from places of marginalization and disadvantage, because men seem to be men no matter which race they're in. And so women, I think it's just critical for us to not only lift up black women, to lift up women of color, to lift up women when we do right.  But to recognize that we're also always in coalition trying to get this done.  So then the big question is, where do we go from here? What is the job? Everyone has a job for you. I mean, some people want you to run for president. Some people want you to take up the mantle in Georgia. Some people say, Stacey Abrams, you've got to keep going for Georgia. Georgia is the future. So you should be the governor. I know that you've publicly said that you won't be running, but my question to you is, why wouldn't you run for governor of Georgia?  Well, so my first jobs, I need to get people to buy my last book. Our Time is now that tells the story of how we build these things. But my job is to say I am going to continue to focus on Georgia, focus on redistricting, focus on the fact that already Brad Ratzenberger is agitating and advocating for rolling back voting rights. Focus on the work we have to still do to make certain that covid recovery actually recognizes the disproportionate effect that it has had on a state like Georgia, where you have such high populations of communities of color and no public health infrastructure to speak of, I may run for office again.  I haven't decided what I'm going to do politically, but I know that my work is here, my focus is now, and my mission is to help lift the South.  Starting here in Georgia, Donald Trump was a common cause that people were fighting against. Joe Biden is now going to be the president who has to answer and address many of the issues that many Americans are facing. You don't agree with everything that Joe Biden says or does. And I mean, that's that's part of politics. What are some of the issues that you want to see him addressing? What are some of the things that you feel Joe Biden and his administration need to push for immediately?  I think he's made the right first steps by focusing on covid and covid relief. We have to recognize that the disproportionate infection rate, the disproportionate death rate, the disproportionate loss of income has affected communities of color and women in ways that will continue to reverberate through our economy.  They are starting early on that issue, and I think that's the right start. Number two, we've got to restore our democracy. Defeating Donald Trump was simply attacking one of the symptoms. We've got to fix the disease, which is this Republican insistence that the way to win elections is to keep citizens from voting. And that's a solvable problem. And they know we have the bills ready to go. And the number three, climate action, the fact that he has tapped John Kerry to be an emissary on this issue, the fact that he is really populated his cabinet with people like Jennifer Granholm who understand how we can take climate action and turn it into job creation, turn it into a community opportunity, turn it into environmental justice.  Those are the first three things that we focus on. And I think overarching, all of that is making certain that we embed racial justice in every one of these conversations because racial justice cuts across every one of these issues. And if we do it right, we can start to finally reckon with who we are and what we can become after every victory.  There's a moment of celebration after hard work. There's a moment where you reap the rewards. Stacey Abrams going on on a vacation. I know it's hard in a pandemic. There's not many places you can go, but Georgia has, like, beautiful lakes and you've got beautiful areas you can. Are you going to take some time off? I am so excited.  My younger sister Leslie likes to. But bother the dickens out of me because I don't vacation, but I am going on vacation and I am so excited and I need the rest.  What do you do on vacation? What is Stacey Abrams doing vacation? Are you are you that like, sit down, read a book, do nothing type like on a beach type thing, or are you the kayak on like on like a river type person.  Who are you kayaking on. A river is what you do when you're on an active vacation with people who know how to do the balance. But I'm going on vacation by myself and I will be reading. I will occasionally roll over and maybe watch something on TV and then roll back over and start the next book. And I'm going to take really, really long naps. I'm so excited about sleeping.  Well, enjoy the naps, enjoy the reading. And I'm excited to see what the future of Stacey Abrams holds. Thank you so much for joining us again on the show, Trevor.  Thank you for having me again. You're fantastic.  Don't forget Stacy Abrams latest book, Our Time is Now is currently available. So if you want to change your world, go out and get it. All right. We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back after this.  Well, that's our show for tonight, but before we go, the coronavirus pandemic is as bad as it has ever been, but luckily our first responders are still out there on the front lines saving lives.

What is happening? Traceroute called it.  Wow, I never thought I'd see this day. So Fox News, pro Biden, now Wellmont, pro Biden.  But there they're definitely bivy, curious. Either way, it looks like it's splitsville for Fox News and Donald Trump. And I'd be worried if I were FOX, because if there's one thing Trump actually has experience in, it's dumping blond's.  I mean, either way, though, looks like Trump's supporters can't be happy to see his favorite news network abandon him. What do you think Trump supporters are going to do?  Well, they'll take some time to process the loss, maybe disconnect from the media for a while, the curl up with a good novel and consider that maybe they'd be happy.  You're not living in a constant state of seething rage and grievance.  Oh, that actually sounds nice. Do you think that's really what they'll do? No. They're finding somewhere else to guzzle their cocktail of made up bullshit. Right wing fanatics have fled like this since they were buying tickets to Argentina at the end of World War Two. And lucky for them, small outlets like Newsmax, TV and OEM are offering a new place to call home.  Trump won the election. Hell, he won. And the only thing Democrats can do is trick all of us into believing he didn't stop declaring Biden as the winner because it ain't over yet.  They are trying to convince us that Joe Biden have more of the popular vote than any other president in history. Mathematically, that's impossible, right?  Right now, Joe Biden is pretending to be the president elect and it's OK elect Joe Biden.  I don't think so. I just don't think so. It doesn't look right. It doesn't sound right. Doesn't feel right.  You remember the heavyweight champion, Joe Frazier. He died eight years ago. He voted two years ago. The actor Will Smith has a grandfather who died about four years ago. He's voted in the last two elections and that number now is growing. I think it's up to seven hundred dead people who voted in Philadelphia.  God isn't a great treasurer. Joe Frazier and Will Smith's granddad are voting together. It's amazing how exciting the news can be when you just make it up.  OK, but but, Lewis, this is the first time I've ever heard of these channels. Like, is anyone really watching them?  Oh, you bet your liberal bubble ass they are. These networks is thriving. At the end of October, Newsmax averaged sixty five thousand viewers. But just a week after the election, some of these shows are breaking up a million viewers. That's Korona level growth. And good luck trying to vaccinate against stupid Phizer. And Trever, when I see how the right wing media is exploiting its gullible viewers, it makes me sad and also jealous. I want in.  You want. And what does that even mean, Lewis?  It means I'm starting my own network. You saw Newsmax in 08 and look like all it takes is a few bargain-basement graphics, no editorial standards and a tenuous grip on reality. This is the job I was born for. Check it out.  Are you sick of those commies at Fox News spewing their left wing propaganda? Then sign up for Newsmax TV. You get the political insights you crave from the angriest man on TV. The Democratic Party is trying. You're right now with Newsmax TV. You know what to think about all of today's newsmakers like you see Jason Carville, Joe Biden Jr., I think he would make a great president. I can't believe what I do for money, and it's not just politics, Newsmax will give you the whether the liberal media won't tell you about this hurricane because the whole was the wind you can here.  So it's not real and all the sports you can handle. I don't trust NBA players, and I think you know why. The black stuff. Oh, yeah, he just said that out loud. Other networks will imply, but this point gets forty nine.  Ninety nine a month or fifty nine. Ninety nine. If you want the shirtless version. So sign up today for Newsmax TV. Give me your money. How about a driver? Right now, we've got a deal, 12 months for the price of 50.  Yeah, I'm going to have to think about it, Lewis. That's all right. Get your credit card number. What how did you how did you get a card by now, Lewis? How did you get my credit card, Lewis? All right, I'm going to go cancel my credit card, but when we come back, Congresswoman Lucy McBath tells me about how Democrats can win or lose Georgia and Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn is joining us on the show.  You don't want to miss it.  I call them that. How do you cancel a card and lose? I charge me already.  On September 17th, 2009, 24 year old MIT Chris Richardson disappeared without a trace in the woods near Malibu, California.  She had been arrested at a beachside restaurant for failing to pay a tab and taken to the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. You know, I mean, she's not from that area. And I would hate to wake up to a morning report. Well, lost somewhere to a job. The police released her just after midnight with no car, no cell phone, no money. She doesn't know the area. She's never been in your area. Well, I think she said, Chris, that what happened is that's way more than just her, OK?  My trees disappeared into the darkness and was never seen alive again. I'm Catherine Townsend, host of the podcast Houngan, we're going to try to find out what really happened to my Chris Richardson School of Humans and I heart radio present. Helen, season three. Listen to and gone on the I Heart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Congresswoman Lucy McBath of Georgia.  We talked about her state's importance in this election and how losing her son to gun violence motivated her to become the lawmaker that she is today.  Congresswoman McBath, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Well, thank you. I'm so excited to be with you. And I have to be honest with you. My youngest sister is your biggest fan. And my family's always said, where are you going to be on this show? Once you're on a show, you've really made it.  So now we're validating me. Wow. I like how they've got shifted priorities because in my world, becoming a congresswoman and living the life that you have lived and how you got that many people know your story, but for those who don't. You started your story from a place that I feel many people should start in politics, and that is a personal place. You were a flight attendant for most of your life. You lost your son to gun violence and you didn't just mourn his passing.  You decided to step up and do something about it. And so you ran to change not just his world, but the world and how America sees guns. So in my world, you have made it and we're going to talk about all of that today. So thank you so much for joining us on the show. Let's start first talking about Georgia, because that's what's really in the news right now. Georgia has become what many people thought would never be a battleground states.  When you look at what has happened in Georgia, do you think that this is Georgia changing or do you think that this is Georgia responding to Donald Trump? Georgia is changing, Trevor, as I've been saying for years now, that this is the new South and I think the resistance that we've seen is just that the resistance to the New South and just the amazing movement building that's been done, the strategizing that's been done, the grassroots organizing that's been done.  I knew we were going to be a top tier battleground state. And so I've been telling people all along, please invest in Georgia. The best is yet to come. And we've we've shown that, you know, we made President Trump a one term president and we've actually been able to be a deciding state for president elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. So, yes, the South is changing. And I'm glad that this Peach State has the ability to be on the front lines of that.  Reading your memoir. I mean, it's inspiring and it's heartbreaking at the same time, because you read this tale of a woman who goes through the gripping experience of losing her son. Your son was shot by a man who felt like his friend was playing the music too loud in the car. That was it. And then try to use Stand Your Ground laws to defend what he had done and taking his life. You then use this and that's become part of the title of your book is Standing Our Ground.  What do you think it is about the coalition of mothers that you formed around the country that has moved the idea of gun advocacy forward? Well, as mothers, as women, we're the central focus of our homes, oftentimes we're the protectors where we're often providers, and we want to make sure that when we send our family out the door, when we send our children out the door, that they come home safely, we do everything that we can.  And so building this grassroots coalition of mothers and also survivors is really indicative of what we need to do, what we'll have to do to make sure that we are providing safe spaces for our children and our families in our own communities. And that's what we've been doing. And over 90 believe in gun safety legislation, common sense legislation that really will provide safety nets for our families, and also making sure that a law abiding gun owners are using their guns in a way that is providing a safety net as well.  When they're using those guns, a lot of people in your position would have become a single issue candidates. A lot of people in your position would have gone. All I'm here to talk about is guns. But you're actually looking to to improve health care, to improve gun reform, to improve veterans health care, you know, and then the support that veterans get. And you've really been fighting for a lot of these issues, which surprisingly, as a Democrats, you've gotten signed by Donald Trump not once, not twice, but three times.  So the question then is. How have you managed to work laws or create ideas that have gotten a signoff from Republicans who have shown the ability to block so many different ideas?  I've always reached across the aisle to find some common ground with my Republican colleagues that we could work upon, because when we don't work together and we we end up in the mess that we've been in it in for so long now because we've not been working together for the sake of our constituents that are really depending on us in Washington every single day to create value for them. Our constituents all have the same power to provide the best of what America says they deserve.  Representative Jim Clyburn said something interesting, and this was after the results started coming in and it was apparent that Joe Biden had won. But down ballot Democrats seem to have taken a beating and he said there was no denying that defund the police and abolish the police and socialism hurt the Democrats message.  As somebody who is elected in a state that is really moderate and very close, how do you communicate some of these ideas? Like is there is there a different way that you communicate progressive ideas without isolating Republican or moderate voters?  I wish, of course, we'd been able to pick up more seats for the House, but we have to find what works within your own community. That's what I have said to my colleagues all the time. Is that what I say or what I represent to my community might be completely different from another community, another from another one of my colleagues. I would love for us to be able to hold on to some of the states, some of my colleagues that came in with me, my freshman colleagues.  I was very pained by the fact that they won't be returning with us. But there again, I think that each of us has been able to just really speak very candidly to our own constituents. All of our demographics are different. But as I said, you know, there are a lot of different voices in this caucus and that that's what makes us so unique.  I'll be honest, I think that's one of the things that makes you unique, is that not only are you a symbol of that, but you articulated so well to everybody who takes the time to listen. Thank you so much for coming on the show. And thank you to your family who think that I am the thing that means you've made it. I don't agree, but I appreciate that. So thank you so much to your youngest sister, because between me and her, she's right.  She's not right, but she's very right. So thank you very much.  Thank you, Chairman. I just want to say this. Thank you so much for having such a deep conversation with me, because it reminds me of the conversations I used to have at the kitchen table with Jordan. So thank you for that.  Thank you very much. Thank you. That means the world to me. Take care.  Don't forget Congresswoman Macbeth's memoir, Standing Our Ground. Another story is now available in paperback.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Earlier today, I spoke with Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn. We talked about her life off the slopes, the new reality show that she's cohosting with her dog and so much more.  Lindsey Vonn, welcome to The Daily Social Distancing Show.  Thank you. Good to be here. Before we get into all the things that you are doing, I wonder if you are ever happy that you retired when you did. Because I feel like you retired and then the whole world had to retire because of coronavirus. I remember when you were retiring, I was like, oh, Lindsey, what are you going to do now? You're just going to sit at home and eat like chips and do nothing to enjoy your life.  Loser. And now we are all losers with you. Are you happy now?  Yeah. You know, I think it was pretty good timing. I'm not going to lie. I'm not jealous of everyone that's trying to travel the world right now.  Let's talk a little bit about what Lindsey Vonn has been doing since then. You have an exciting new show called The Pack, and you shot this before the virus shutdowns. Is there any fun show where you are competing like people competing against each other? But the teammate is the dog.  I mean, it's way better than having a teammate as a human being. I think it's a lot more exciting. But yeah, this is my lovely co-host, Lucy, my dog. It was a really fun show to do, actually. And we were right, right, right. Before covid happened, you were kind of escaping every city before it kind of got shut down now.  Yes, it was a little bit intense, but luckily we made it through. We got the whole series done. And on Friday, you guys will see the finished product."}]}
